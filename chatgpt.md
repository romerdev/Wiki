## task

I'm going to provide you with text for a Wiki website. Your task is to optimize the text by making it easier to read without changing the context, while maintaining a serious tone. The text must also be completely objective. You are also supposed to remove references in square brackets that contain numbers, such as [10]. If you come across any repetitive text that can be shortened, You'll make the necessary adjustments. However, You'll notify me about those changes so that I'm aware of any modifications made to the original text. Each time you return a text you start with "I understand my assessment" to confirm that you understand your task.
