The band members initially met in secondary school and began performing together as teenagers in 2002. They started releasing music professionally in 2012. The band's early gigs, organized by a council worker, caught the attention of Dirty Hit and Polydor Records, leading them to sign a record deal. From 2012 to 2013, they opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays, including "Facedown," "Sex," "Music for Cars," and "IV." These releases set the stage for their self-titled debut album, "The 1975," which reached number one on the UK charts in 2013. The album featured popular singles such as "Sex," "Chocolate," and "Robbers."

All of the band's albums have achieved number one status in the United Kingdom and have charted on the Billboard 200. They have received critical acclaim, appearing on numerous year-end and decade-end lists. Their second album, "I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It" (2016), also reached number one in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The album's box set received a nomination for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package at the 59th Grammy Awards. The band's third album, "A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships" (2018), received widespread acclaim and won British Album of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. The single "Give Yourself A Try" from this album earned a nomination for Best Rock Song at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. They followed up with "Notes on a Conditional Form" (2020) and "Being Funny in a Foreign Language" (2022), with the latter receiving a nomination for British Album of the Year at the 2023 Brit Awards.

The band is known for their musical eclecticism and sharp lyricism, and they have garnered several awards and nominations, including four Brit Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards, and a Grammy Award nomination. In 2020, they were awarded "Band of the Decade" at the NME Awards.

## History

### 2002–2011: Formation

In 2002, Adam Hann, who plays guitar, recruited Matty Healy to be the drummer for a band he was forming with Ross MacDonald, who plays bass. This happened during their time at Wilmslow High School. The initial singer, Elliot Williams, dropped out after one rehearsal, leading Healy to take over as both the lead vocalist and drummer. Eventually, George Daniel joined the band as the drummer, a change that Healy described as life-changing. Daniel's first impression of Healy was that he was the most outwardly passionate person in school. The quartet started by playing covers of punk and emo songs at school and Healy's house before progressing to writing their own music.

To keep the band together, Hann, MacDonald, and Daniel attended university in Manchester, while Healy briefly attended music school. They continued playing gigs and recording their own music while working as delivery boys at a local Chinese restaurant.

In 2010, Jamie Oborne took on the band's management but struggled to secure a record deal due to their genre-hopping approach. As a result, he established his own independent record label called Dirty Hit and signed the band for £20.

Before settling on the name "The 1975," the band performed under various names, including Me and You Versus Them, Those 1975s, Forever Drawing Six, Talkhouse, the Slowdown, and Bigsleep. They were previously known as Drive Like I Do before finally deciding on the name "The 1975" in 2012. Healy mentioned that the final name was inspired by scribblings found on the back page of Jack Kerouac's book, "On the Road."

> "I found a page of scribblings in Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road.' It wasn't disturbing or dark, but what struck me was the date written on it: '1st June, The 1975.' The use of 'The' before a date felt powerful to me at the time. Little did I know that it would become so significant. When it came to naming the band, it felt perfect."

### 2012–2014: Early career and self-titled debut album

The band's self-titled debut album, produced by Mike Crossey, was released on 2 September 2013. Prior to the album release, the band recorded four EPs between Autumn 2012 and Spring 2013. They embarked on various tours to support the album, including gigs and special appearances with other artists.

The album received positive reviews from critics and reached the top spot on the UK Albums Chart on 8 September. By March 2016, it had sold 410,981 copies in the UK and 390,000 copies in the US. Critics at Pitchfork compared their sound favorably to the Big Pink. The Sex EP was described by Paste as a blend of ethereal and synth pop, featuring haunting and smooth vocals. The band's mellow and stripped-down style was praised for its lack of attention-grabbing production theatrics.

The band gained UK airplay with their first EP, Facedown, in August 2012. Their track "The City" was featured on a BBC Introducing show with Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1. In late 2012, their single "Sex" from the eponymous EP received attention from BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe. The band embarked on tours in the UK, Ireland, and the US to promote their releases. Their song "Chocolate" from the Music for Cars EP achieved mainstream chart success, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. They continued to release new music, including the track "The City" on their EP IV.

The 1975 extensively toured and built hype before releasing their debut album. They supported Muse on The 2nd Law World Tour and performed with the Neighbourhood in the US. They also had the opportunity to support the Rolling Stones and performed at the 2013 Reading and Leeds Festivals on the Festival Republic Stage.

Releasing a series of EPs before their debut album allowed the band to provide context to their broad sound. It was a deliberate move to ensure that they could express themselves properly before unveiling their ambitious debut record.

Their self-titled debut album, The 1975, was released on 2 September 2013 and was co-produced by Mike Crossey, known for his work with Arctic Monkeys and Foals. Prior to the album release, the band had already gained popularity and sold-out shows. The lead single, a re-worked version of "Sex," premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show and topped the UK Albums Chart.

The public reaction to the band's music has been mixed, with opinions varying on social media platforms like Twitter. Some consider them underrated, while others think they are overhyped. Notably, rock critic Robert Christgau expressed his negative opinion of the band. However, the band's debut album was well-received as a straightforward rock record with a distinct British sensibility. Their subsequent album, "I Like It When You Sleep," was described as pop in the realm of Alternative, with comparisons made to INXS.

The band embarked on various tours, including performances in the UK, North America, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. They played at notable venues such as London's Shepherd's Bush Empire and the Royal Albert Hall. They also performed at major music festivals like Coachella.

In conclusion, the band's early years were marked by the release of EPs, successful tours, and the critical and commercial success of their self-titled debut album. Their music has received a range of reactions, but they have managed to establish a strong presence in the music industry through their distinct sound and captivating live performances.
