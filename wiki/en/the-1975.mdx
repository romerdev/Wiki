The band members met in secondary school, and first performed together as teenagers in 2002, professionally releasing music since 2012. Gigs organised by a council worker led the band to sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. From 2012–13, they opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays – Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV – before releasing their UK chart-topping self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles "Sex", "Chocolate", and "Robbers".

All of the band’s albums hit No. 1 in the United Kingdom and charted in the Billboard 200, garnering critical praise and appearing in numerous publications' year-end and decade-end lists. Their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016), also reached No. 1 in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and its box set received a nomination for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package at the 59th Grammy Awards. The band's third album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships (2018), received widespread acclaim and won British Album of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards with its single “Give Yourself A Try” earning a nomination for Best Rock Song at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. This was followed by Notes on a Conditional Form (2020) and Being Funny in a Foreign Language (2022) with the latter receiving a nomination for British Album of the Year at the 2023 Brit Awards.

Acclaimed for their musical eclecticism and sharp lyricism, the band has received several awards and nominations including four Brit Awards and two Ivor Novello Awards. In addition, they have been awarded "Band of the Decade" at the 2020 NME Awards.
