The band's journey into the music industry started with the independent release of the extended play "Safety" in 1998, subsequently signing with Parlophone in 1999. Their debut album, "[Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes)" (2000), featuring the groundbreaking single "Yellow", earned a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and a Mercury Prize nomination. The successful trajectory continued with their second album, "A Rush of Blood to the Head" (2002), yielding accolades such as a Grammy Award for the single "Clocks". The completion of their intended trilogy, "X&Y" (2005), received a nomination for Best Rock Album at the Grammys.

Coldplay’s fourth album, "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" (2008), maintained the winning streak, securing the Best Rock Album title. Additionally, both "X&Y" and "Viva la Vida" reigned as the best-selling albums of their respective years, topping charts in over 30 countries. Particularly noteworthy is the title track of "Viva la Vida", which became the first single by a British group in the 21st century to concurrently attain the number one position in the United Kingdom and United States.

Over their next five studio albums, the most recent of which being "Music of the Spheres" (2021), Coldplay ventured into a wider range of genres such as electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, classical, and progressive rock, with each album offering a unique theme. Celebrated for their "euphoric" and "immersive" live performances, the band was lauded by NME for truly coming alive on stage. In 2018, a documentary encapsulating the band's journey over two decades was released, directed by Mat Whitecross.

Coldplay, having sold over 100 million albums globally, ranks among the best-selling music acts of all time. They hold the title for the most Brit Awards won by a band and were ranked as the sixth-most awarded group in history by Fuse in 2014. Among other accomplishments, they boast three of the top 50 highest-selling albums in the UK and hold the record for the most number-one albums (nine) without ever missing the top. The band's track "My Universe" made history in 2021 by making them the first British group to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, they claim two of the top 10 highest-grossing tours of all time.

Coldplay's influence is recognized by many, as they are often cited as one of the most pioneering acts in the music world. Forbes dubbed them a standard-bearer for the contemporary alternative music scene, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame honored their album "A Rush of Blood to the Head" and their hit "Yellow" for their substantial contributions to the music industry. However, despite their extensive popularity and impact, Coldplay has remained a somewhat divisive presence in the music industry.

## History

### 1997–1999: Formation and first years

Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first encountered each other during their orientation week at University College London in September 1996. The two began crafting songs together in early 1997, dedicating their evenings to practice. Guy Berryman, the third member, joined the band in the ensuing months. Known as Big Fat Noises by November, they produced several demos without a drummer. In 1998, the line-up was completed by Will Champion, who ended up filling the drummer's seat by chance when the original drummer didn't show up for practice.

  <blockquote>
    The final name change came courtesy of close friend and fellow UCL student
    Tim Crompton. Tim was in the process of putting a band of old schoolmates
    together (later called Bettina Motive). While killing time waiting for a
    delayed removal van, he had considered the name after he found a copy of
    Philip Horky's book, Child's Reflections, Cold Play. Tim had a list of
    potential band names but Cold Play was quickly rejected; the future
    bandmates didn't like it, so they discarded it. Starfish were happy to pick
    it up.
  </blockquote>

Shortly after joining the group, Champion coordinated their first live performance, even though they hadn't yet settled on an official band name. Going by the name Starfish, they held their debut gig at The Laurel Tree in Camden on 16 January 1998. In the following weeks, they finalized their name as Coldplay. In May 1998, they released Safety, an independently financed EP produced with the help of Martin's longtime friend, Phil Harvey. Of the 500 copies pressed, 150 were released to the public.

Unhappy with the control a Camden promoter held over them, Martin and the band, on Harvey's advice, organized their own gig at Dingwalls, selling 50 copies of Safety. This event marked the beginning of Harvey's management of Coldplay, leading him to abandon his Classical Studies degree at Trinity College, Oxford, to focus on the band. Throughout the summer, they performed at numerous concerts, including two alongside Keane. Martin once offered Tim Rice-Oxley a role as Coldplay's keyboardist, but the rest of the band were not inclined to add a new member. Coldplay caught the eye of A&R scout Debs Wild at Manchester's In the City showcase in September 1998, which led to the release of a demo cassette featuring "Ode to Deodorant" and "Brothers & Sisters".

Wild brought the band to the attention of BMG Publishing's Caroline Elleray and music lawyer Gavin Maude. Maude reached out to Simon Williams of Fierce Panda Records, who later introduced the band to BBC Radio's Steve Lamacq. On 3 January 1999, Coldplay became the first unsigned act to appear on Lamacq's Evening Session. A month later, they struck a short-term deal with Fierce Panda and re-recorded "Brothers & Sisters". With growing popularity and six contract offers from other labels, Coldplay decided to sign with Parlophone. They sealed the deal in Trafalgar Square in April 1999, the same month "Brothers & Sisters" was released as a single. Amidst these developments, they were also preparing for their final exams at UCL.

Coldplay made their inaugural appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 27 June 1999 in the New Bands Tent. Afterwards, they recorded The Blue Room, pressing and selling 5,000 copies to the public. Initially intended for their debut album, [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes) (2000), the sessions were fraught with conflict over Champion's drumming skills. Martin later recalled that they asked Champion to leave the band after a heated argument, but invited him back three days later, realizing their mistake. To foster harmony and maintain focus, the band implemented democratic decision-making and a zero-tolerance policy on hard drugs, a choice inspired by bands like R.E.M. and U2.

### 2000–2001: Parachutes

Coldplay initially planned to record their debut album, [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes), in two weeks. However, because of tours and live performances, the recording process stretched from September 1999 to April-May 2000. The recording sessions took place at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios, under the guidance of producer Ken Nelson. Most of the album, however, was recorded at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, using three studio rooms. American engineer Michael Brauer in New York mixed all of the album's songs. In this period, Coldplay also performed in the Carling Tour, showcasing new musical acts.

Coldplay's first Top 40 hit came with the lead single from [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes), "Shiver," released in March 2000. The release coincided with Coldplay's performance at The Forum in Tunbridge Wells as part of the NME Premier Tour. "Shiver" reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. In June 2000, Coldplay embarked on their first headlining tour, including a performance at the Glastonbury Festival. They also released "Yellow," their first song to enter the top five, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. The music video for "Yellow," filmed at Studland Bay in Dorset, featured Chris Martin singing in a continuous shot on the beach.

Coldplay released [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes) on 10 July 2000 in the United Kingdom via their label, Parlophone. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and was released on 7 November 2000 by Nettwerk in North America. The album was available in various formats, including CD and cassette. Four singles were released from [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes), including "Shiver" and "Yellow," both of which enjoyed popularity in the UK and US.

[Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes) received a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize in September 2000. Following success in Europe, the band released the album in North America in November 2000 and embarked on the US Club Tour in February 2001. At the 2001 Brit Awards, Coldplay won Best British Group and Best British Album. [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes) was a slow-burning success in the United States, eventually reaching double-platinum status. The album was also critically acclaimed and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 2002 Grammy Awards.

Chris Martin expressed his ambition for Coldplay to become the "biggest, best band in the world" following the release of [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes). Phil Harvey, who had managed the band single-handedly until early 2001, stepped down due to the stress of the role. He then became the group's creative director and is often referred to as the fifth member of the band. Dave Holmes took over the role as Coldplay's manager.

### 2002–2004: A Rush of Blood to the Head

Following the success of their debut album, Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to work on their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, with Ken Nelson once again serving as the producer. The band relocated to Liverpool for the recording process as they found it hard to concentrate in London. The first song recorded for the album was "In My Place," which rekindled their enthusiasm for creating a second album during a period of uncertainty after the success of [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes). The song led to a flurry of creativity, with more than 20 songs being written for the album.

<Spotify link="https://open.spotify.com/track/75JFxkI2RXiU7L9VXzMkle" />

Some of the new material, including "In My Place" and "Animals," was performed live while the band was still touring for [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes). The album, titled via a post on the band's official website, was released in August 2002, and produced several successful singles, including "In My Place," "Clocks," and "The Scientist." "The Scientist" was inspired by George Harrison's 1970 song "All Things Must Pass."

The band toured extensively from June 2002 to September 2003 for the A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour, visiting five continents and co-headlining festival dates at Glastonbury Festival, V2003, and Rock Werchter. Many of these concerts featured elaborate lighting and individual screens, reminiscent of tours by U2 and Nine Inch Nails. During the tour, Coldplay recorded a live DVD and CD, Live 2003, at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion.

At the 2003 Brit Awards, Coldplay won Best British Group and Best British Album. They also performed "The Scientist" at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City and won three awards.

In December 2003, readers of Rolling Stone magazine voted Coldplay as the best artist and the best band of the year. They also released a cover of the Pretenders' 1983 song "2000 Miles," which became the top-selling UK download of the year, with proceeds donated to Future Forests and the Stop Handgun Violence campaigns.

A Rush of Blood to the Head won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards, and at the 2004 Grammy Awards, Coldplay won Record of the Year for "Clocks."

### 2005–2007: X&amp;Y

After spending most of 2004 out of the spotlight, Coldplay returned to the music scene in 2005 with their third album, X&Y. Released in June in the UK and Europe, the album quickly became the best-selling album of 2005, with worldwide sales of 8.3 million copies. The lead single, "Speed of Sound," was released in April and May, and X&Y debuted at number one on the album charts in 20 countries, marking it as the third-fastest-selling album in UK chart history.

Two more singles, "Fix You" and "Talk," were released in September and December, respectively. While critical reaction to X&Y was largely positive, it was slightly less enthusiastic than for its predecessor, A Rush of Blood to the Head. Some critics made comparisons between Coldplay and U2, and The New York Times' Jon Pareles called Coldplay "the most insufferable band of the decade." However, NME rated the album 9/10, calling it "Confident, bold, ambitious, bunged with singles and impossible to contain." Frontman Chris Martin took the critical review by The New York Times in stride, saying he agreed with many of the points and felt liberated by the recognition of the band's flaws.

Coldplay embarked on the Twisted Logic Tour from June 2005 to March 2007, including performances at festivals like Coachella, Isle of Wight Festival, Glastonbury, and the Austin City Limits Music Festival. In July 2005, they appeared at Live 8 in Hyde Park and performed a rendition of The Verve's "Bitter Sweet Symphony" with Richard Ashcroft on vocals. They also performed "Speed of Sound" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami in August.

In September 2005, they recorded a new version of "How You See the World" with reworked lyrics for War Child's Help!: A Day in the Life charity album. In February 2006, they won Best Album and Best Single at the Brit Awards. Three more singles—"The Hardest Part," "What If," and "White Shadows"—were released during 2006 and 2007.

### 2008–2010: Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends

In October 2006, Coldplay began work on their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, with producer Brian Eno. While recording, the band took a break to tour Latin America, finishing their Twisted Logic Tour with performances in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Influenced by their time touring, the band infused the album with Hispanic elements.

Viva la Vida marked a departure from the band's past three albums, with Martin noting that those albums felt like a finished "trilogy." He revealed that the album featured less of his falsetto, leaning more on his voice's lower register. The album's first single, "Violet Hill," was released in April 2008, followed by the title track, "Viva la Vida," which became the band's first number-one single on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Official Charts.

Upon release, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends topped the album charts worldwide and became the world's best-selling album of 2008. Despite being on the market for only three days, it hit number one on the UK album chart, setting a new record for the most-downloaded album ever. The album was further recognized when Coldplay won two Q Awards for Best Album and Best Act in the World Today.

Coldplay kicked off their Viva la Vida Tour in June 2008. They also released the Prospekt's March EP in November 2008, featuring songs from the album sessions. Despite the success of the album, it was not without controversy. In December 2008, musician Joe Satriani filed a copyright infringement suit against Coldplay, claiming that "Viva la Vida" included portions of his song "If I Could Fly." The case was eventually settled out of court.

In 2009, Coldplay won three Grammy Awards for "Viva la Vida" and the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. They also released a live album, LeftRightLeftRightLeft, recorded at various shows during the tour. Following the tour, Coldplay announced another Latin America tour for early 2010. In October of the same year, they won Song of the Year for "Viva la Vida" at The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) Awards. The band rounded off 2010 by releasing "Christmas Lights," which featured a cameo from actor Simon Pegg in its music video.

### 2011–2012: Mylo Xyloto

In mid-2011, Coldplay completed the recording of their fifth studio album. The lyrical themes, as described by Martin, revolved around "love, addiction, OCD, escape and working for someone you don't like." The band confirmed several festival appearances for the year, including headlining spots at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Rock in Rio, and Lollapalooza festival.

In early 2011, two new songs, "Princess of China" and "Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall", were confirmed to be included in the upcoming album. The first single, "Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall", was released on 3 June 2011. During the summer, the band debuted five new songs at various festivals.

On 12 August 2011, the band announced their new album, Mylo Xyloto, to be released on 24 October 2011. The second single, "Paradise", was released on 12 September. Mylo Xyloto topped the charts in over 34 countries upon its release, though it received mixed to positive reviews.

Coldplay performed songs at Apple Inc.'s private memorial for Steve Jobs in October 2011 and played a live webcast concert at Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas in Madrid, Spain, later in the month. The band received three Grammy nominations for the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012 and performed with Rihanna at the ceremony.

In 2012, Mylo Xyloto was the best-selling rock album in the UK, and its second single, "Paradise", was also the best-selling rock single in the country. The album won the Best Rock Video award at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. Coldplay headlined the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Paralympic Games and gave bands participating in the Bandstand Marathon permission to perform "Viva la Vida".

The music video for the song "Hurts Like Heaven" was released in October 2012, portraying the story of a boy named Mylo Xyloto living under the tyranny of Major Minus. This story was continued in a comic series released in 2013. A concert documentary film and live album, Coldplay Live 2012, was released in November 2012, chronicling their tour in support of Mylo Xyloto.

In November 2012, after a concert in Brisbane, Australia, the band hinted at a three-year break from touring. They performed two shows with Jay-Z in Brooklyn, New York, on 30 December and New Year's Eve, ending the Mylo Xyloto Tour. The tour was the fourth-highest-grossing worldwide in 2012, earning more than $171.3 million in ticket sales.

### 2013–2014: Ghost Stories

Following their successful Mylo Xyloto tour, Chris Martin of Coldplay announced in an interview with Australian radio station 2Day FM that their next album's title would be easier to pronounce. Martin dispelled rumors of a three-year break from touring, explaining that the statement was in relation to the regular timeline of a world tour.

On 9 August 2013, Coldplay announced the release of their song "Atlas" for the film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which was eventually released in September 2013. The band shifted their US distribution to Atlantic Records following Warner Music Group's acquisition of Parlophone Records from EMI in December 2013.

The band unveiled a track called "Midnight" from their upcoming album on 25 February 2014. The following month, the band announced their sixth album, Ghost Stories, which was set for release on 19 May 2014. The album, described by Chris Martin as spiritually driven, explores themes of past actions, their future consequences, and the capacity for unconditional love. This album was different from the previous ones as Martin invited band members to contribute original songwriting material, rather than building songs solely from his ideas.

From April to July 2014, Coldplay went on a six-date Ghost Stories Tour, playing intimate shows in six cities worldwide. The album was made available for pre-order on iTunes, with "Magic" as a new single. Two additional singles, "A Sky Full of Stars" and "True Love", were released subsequently. Ghost Stories received mixed to positive reviews, topping the charts in major markets, including the UK and the US. It was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammy Awards, and "A Sky Full of Stars" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. In December 2014, Spotify announced that Coldplay was the most-streamed band and the third most-streamed artist in the world for that year, behind Ed Sheeran and Eminem.

### 2015–2018: A Head Full of Dreams

In December 2014, Chris Martin announced on BBC Radio 1 that Coldplay were working on their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams, hinting that it might be their last. He compared the album to the final Harry Potter book and indicated that the band intended to tour for this album, unlike the previous one. The band wanted the album to be colourful, uplifting, and danceable.

They released a new song, "Miracles", for the film Unbroken, and their previous album Ghost Stories won Top Rock Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards. Coldplay headlined the 2015 Global Citizen Festival, which was organised by Chris Martin to help end extreme poverty.

In November 2015, Coldplay confirmed the release of A Head Full of Dreams, premiering the song "Adventure of a Lifetime". The album featured guest appearances from notable figures such as Beyoncé, Gwyneth Paltrow, Noel Gallagher, Tove Lo, and Barack Obama. The album charted well, reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US, Australia, and Canada, where it was second to Adele's 25.

In 2016, Coldplay embarked on the A Head Full of Dreams Tour, headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show alongside Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, and closed the final day of the Glastonbury Festival in England. They also performed a full set in India for the first time as part of the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai.

Towards the end of 2016, Coldplay announced they would be releasing new songs in a new EP called the Kaleidoscope EP. The EP was released on 14 July 2017 and featured a successful collaboration track with The Chainsmokers called "Something Just Like This".

In October 2017, Coldplay debuted their new song "Life Is Beautiful" live, written in support of the earthquake that affected Mexico. They promised that the proceeds from the song and concert would go towards relief efforts for Mexico and other affected countries.

Their A Head Full of Dreams Tour ended in November 2017 and was the third-highest-grossing concert tour of all time, grossing over $523 million. A live album, Live in Buenos Aires, was released in December 2018. The same month, Coldplay released Global Citizen – EP 1 under the name Los Unidades, featuring a song with Pharrell Williams and Jozzy, with proceeds going towards efforts to end global poverty.

### 2019–2020: Everyday Life

In September 2019, Global Citizen announced that Coldplay would be performing at Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream event, to take place on September 26, 2020. In October of the same year, cryptic black-and-white posters featuring the band in vintage-style clothing began to appear around the world, sparking speculation about new material. This speculation was further fueled by the band's change in their social media profile pictures and a brief teaser with orchestral music.

On October 21, 2019, Coldplay announced in a letter to fans that their eighth studio album would be titled Everyday Life and would be a double album, divided into Sunrise and Sunset. The tracks of the album were later revealed through advertisements in local newspapers in the UK. The album's lead singles, "Orphans" and "Arabesque", were released on October 24, 2019. Notably, "Arabesque" became the first Coldplay song to contain profanity.

Everyday Life was released on November 22, 2019, and was marked by a double concert in Amman, Jordan, performed at sunrise and sunset to align with the two halves of the album. Chris Martin had stated that the band would not tour for this album until they could figure out a way to make it not just sustainable, but beneficial for the environment. Nonetheless, the band did perform a one-off show at London's Natural History Museum for the charity ClientEarth.

Everyday Life debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the band's eighth consecutive UK number-one album and the third fastest-selling album of 2019. In November 2020, the album received two nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, including a nod for Album of the Year, their first nomination in the category since Viva la Vida. In December 2020, "Flags" was released internationally, after initially being included as a Japanese bonus track on Everyday Life.

### 2021–present: Music of the Spheres

In April 2021, Coldplay announced a new single titled "Higher Power" that would be released on May 7, 2021. The release was accompanied by a video livestream aired from the International Space Station. In an interview, Chris Martin revealed that the band was working with producer Max Martin on the single and their new album, adding that "Max is our producer right now for everything we do". Later in May, Coldplay were announced as the opening act for the 2021 Brit Awards, where they performed "Higher Power".

On May 22, 2021, Coldplay's pre-recorded performance at Glastonbury Festival was broadcast online. During the performance, they debuted a new song titled "Human Heart", featuring R&B duo We Are King. The official music video for "Higher Power", directed by Dave Meyers, premiered on YouTube in June 2021, following a simpler video featuring the band dancing with CGI alien holograms.

In July 2021, Coldplay announced that their new album, Music of the Spheres, would be released on October 15, 2021. They also announced a track titled "Coloratura", which was released later in July. In September, they announced a collaboration with South Korean pop group BTS on the second single "My Universe", which debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the UK Singles Chart.

Music of the Spheres debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling album in the country since Ed Sheeran's 2019 No.6 Collaborations Project. It also debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, and reached number one on both the Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.

In October 2021, Coldplay announced their eighth concert tour, the Music of the Spheres World Tour, to begin in San José, Costa Rica, in March 2022. The tour is part of the band's efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, with concerts powered by kinetic flooring and bicycles that generate renewable energy.

"Higher Power" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards in November 2021. In December, Chris Martin said in an interview with the BBC that Coldplay planned to release three more albums until 2025, with one being "kind of a musical" and their last a "back to the basics" self-titled record. He stated that the band would continue to be active with smaller releases and worldwide touring after 2025.

In February 2022, Coldplay released a stripped-down version of "Let Somebody Go" and a cover of Kid Cudi's 2008 single "Day 'n' Nite". Both songs were part of their Spotify Singles release. Music of the Spheres received three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, with "My Universe" being nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

## Artistry

### Creative process

In an interview with NME, Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band typically starts with a title and concept before the music comes into the picture. This approach provides a thematic framework for their songs. Lead vocalist Chris Martin described their songwriting process as "a series of doors". Martin brings initial ideas to guitarist Jonny Buckland, who either rejects or contributes to them. The same process occurs from Buckland to Berryman, and then to drummer Will Champion. This method allows every band member to have an artistic input in the songwriting process.

However, the process isn't always linear. Some songs, like "Magic" and "Adventure of a Lifetime", originated from bass and guitar riffs from Berryman and Buckland respectively. The members of Coldplay often swap instruments in the studio, further demonstrating their collaborative and flexible approach to creating music.

When asked about the absence of explicit language in their lyrics, Champion acknowledged that although swear words can be "extremely useful at times", their impact is lessened with overuse. This is part of the band's ethos of thoughtful and conscious songwriting.

Critics have noted a pattern in Coldplay's music, alternating between more mainstream, accessible songs and those that are more artsy and aimed at prestige. Buckland acknowledged this, stating that knowing a "big hit is coming allows us to go a lot smaller" and to be more "insular" in their music creation, suggesting a conscious balance between commercial appeal and artistic integrity.

### Musical and lyrical style

Coldplay's musical journey has been characterized by evolution and exploration across multiple genres. Their sound has been defined by a multitude of labels, including alternative rock, pop rock, post-Britpop, soft rock, and pop. Interestingly, upon winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2009, Chris Martin humorously referred to their music as "limestone rock," a gentler contrast to "hard rock."

Their earlier releases in 1998 and 1999 leaned towards dream pop, setting the stage for their future stylistic choices. Their debut studio album, "[Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes)" (2000), was described as "melodic pop" with dark and artistically abrasive undertones. The band shifted towards a more urgent and heartbroken sound with their 2002 album "A Rush of Blood to the Head," which was characterized by plaintive strums and weary arpeggios.

With their 2005 album, "X&Y", Coldplay added electronic influences and used synthesisers extensively, giving the music a grander scale and exploring existential themes. Their 2008 albums, "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" and "Prospekt's March", saw the band experimenting with a wide range of instruments and sounds, under the guidance of producer Brian Eno. This period saw the band incorporating oriental, Hispanic, African, and Middle Eastern influences into their music.

2011's "Mylo Xyloto" was a concept album that included more electronic elements than before and primarily upbeat tones. The band adopted a melancholic and somber style for "Ghost Stories" (2014), featuring electronica, R&B, synth-pop, and ambient influences. This was followed by a similar but more uplifting style in "A Head Full of Dreams" (2015).

In 2017, Coldplay released the "Kaleidoscope EP", which mixed their newfound pop style with their alternative rock roots. This was followed by "Everyday Life" (2019), which returned to the experimentation and organic sounds of "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends", with new influences from gospel, blues, and classical music.

Most recently, the band's 2021 album "Music of the Spheres" leaned towards pop sounds, while still encompassing multiple styles. According to Guy Berryman, this album was created with a focus on live performances. The band incorporated new musical influences, including "Human Heart", an a cappella collaboration with R&B duo We Are King and Jacob Collier, and "Coloratura", a 10-minute progressive rock ballad, the longest song the band has released. The album's promotional phrase, "Everyone is an alien somewhere", embodied the project's theme of unity and perspective.

Throughout their career, Coldplay has been characterized by their willingness to evolve and push their musical boundaries. They have seamlessly woven a tapestry of sounds and themes that speak to universal human experiences, solidifying their status as one of the world's most beloved bands.

### Influences

Coldplay's music has been likened to a range of bands such as a-ha, U2, Oasis, R.E.M., and Radiohead, reflecting the diverse influences and styles they have embraced throughout their career. Early influences on their music included the Scottish band Travis and American singer Jeff Buckley. Notably, their early material was predominantly produced by Ken Nelson.

Lead vocalist, Chris Martin, has cited a diverse range of influences, including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and Jeff Buckley. Martin's religious upbringing introduced him to a variety of hymns, shaping his musical sensibilities. In recent years, he has also mentioned Belgian singer-songwriter Stromae as a significant influence.

Lead guitarist, Jonny Buckland, has expressed that the Stone Roses were a key inspiration for him to learn guitar. His diverse musical tastes, spanning from the Velvet Underground to Björk, are reflected in his wide-ranging playlist shared on social media in 2020. His favorite song is "Teardrop" by Massive Attack.

Bass guitarist, Guy Berryman, has a musical palate rooted in the likes of James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Kool & the Gang, and the Funk Brothers, with a special affection for the Beatles and Motown.

Drummer Will Champion, who began playing the violin and piano from a young age, had a youth immersed in the music of Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Nick Cave, and traditional Irish folk music. Some of his favorite drummers include Ginger Baker, Dave Grohl, and John Bonham.

Throughout their discography, the band's influences have evolved. For instance, their 2002 album "A Rush of Blood to the Head" drew inspiration from Echo & the Bunnymen, George Harrison, and Muse, while "X&Y" (2005) took cues from Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode. The evolution of their sound over subsequent albums saw them collaborating with a range of producers such as Brian Eno, Jon Hopkins, Paul Epworth, Tim Bergling, Madeon, and Stargate.

Their 2008 album "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" marked a shift towards art rock, inspired by bands like My Bloody Valentine, Blur, and Arcade Fire. With the addition of ambient and electronica elements, they moved further away from their initial alternative rock sound.

Their 2021 album, "Music of the Spheres", saw them collaborate with the famed Swedish producer Max Martin, resulting in a pop-influenced sound. Interestingly, the track "People of the Pride" was inspired by a Beyoncé performance, and the promotional single "Coloratura" drew comparisons to Pink Floyd.

Coldplay's rich tapestry of influences, their willingness to explore diverse genres, and their successful collaborations have helped them continually reinvent their sound over the decades, making them one of the most enduring and popular bands of their generation.

### Live performances

Known for their dynamic and visually stunning live performances, Coldplay have established a reputation as one of the most compelling live acts of the 21st century. Their concerts often feature a blend of lasers, fireworks, confetti cannons, and LED wristbands – the latter of which have become a signature element of their performances. These shows are not just auditory but sensory spectacles that fully engage their audiences.

Chris Martin, the band's frontman, is recognized for his ability to connect with audiences through his personable interactions between songs, creating an intimate atmosphere even within the context of large arena or stadium shows. The band's setlists are carefully curated to create a journey for the audience, serving as a reminder of the band's longevity and enduring popularity.

However, in a departure from their typical grand-scale concerts, the Ghost Stories Tour in 2014 saw the band opt for intimate performances in smaller venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and the Beacon Theatre. The shows featured innovative visual elements like a laser harp and the reactable, a novel electronic musical instrument. This demonstrated the band's ability to adapt their performance style to different settings while still providing a unique and memorable experience for their fans.

Their commitment to environmental sustainability was reflected in their approach to the Everyday Life album tour in 2019. Choosing to perform smaller shows for charity and a special livestream at the Amman Citadel in Jordan, they managed to maintain their high-performance standards while also demonstrating their environmental consciousness.

Coldplay's dynamic live performances are often cited as one of the reasons behind their sustained appeal. As Dan Stubbs from NME noted, the stage is where Coldplay truly comes alive. The band has also acknowledged the influence of other dynamic live acts, with drummer Will Champion citing the Flaming Lips as instrumental in shaping their idea of what a concert can be.

In conclusion, whether playing to a small audience in an intimate setting or to thousands of fans in a stadium, Coldplay's live shows have been lauded for their captivating visuals, the band's musicianship, and their ability to foster a strong connection with their audience.

### Fashion and aesthetic

Coldplay's visual and aesthetic choices throughout their career have played a significant role in the narrative and universe of each album. Beginning with the casual "skinny indie kids" look for their early work on [Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes) (2000) and A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), their fashion has evolved with each new project. Frontman Chris Martin's support for the Make Trade Fair campaign was notably reflected in his wardrobe choices, with the institution's logo often adorning his shirts and hands.

The band's aesthetic cohesion was further demonstrated during the X&Y (2005) era, with all members donning black outfits and white shoes. This sartorial uniformity was seen by Martin as symbolizing unity and teamwork, much like the function of an army uniform.

Beginning in 2007, Coldplay began collaborating with stylist Beth Fenton, creating distinct, tailored looks that fit the narrative of each subsequent album. The Beatles and the French Revolution inspired their attire for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), while the urban artistry of graffiti influenced their aesthetic for Mylo Xyloto (2011).

For Ghost Stories (2014), the band turned to Mila Fürstová's melancholic etchings, opting for non-customized outfits with darker tones. During this period, Martin started wearing Love Button Global Movement pins, signifying the organization's mission to inspire acts of kindness and love.

A kaleidoscopic, 70s-inspired look characterized the wardrobe for A Head Full of Dreams (2015), with details like the flower of life emblematic of the album cover. Martin's custom Air Jordans and the stickers adorning the band's instruments, some featuring their children's names, added personal touches to their appearance.

The sepia-toned, vintage imagery of Everyday Life (2019) was inspired by a photograph of Buckland's great-grandfather, incorporating nods to the Arab world as well. For Music of the Spheres (2021), the band adopted a cosmic aesthetic, with wardrobe pieces provided by Applied Art Forms, a fashion label founded by Guy Berryman. Berryman's work in utilitarian, workwear, and military clothing design informed the album's fashion direction.

In conclusion, Coldplay's aesthetic choices are an integral part of their artistic expression, creating a cohesive visual narrative that accompanies their music. By working with stylists and incorporating influences from various sources, they have managed to create distinctive visual identities for each of their albums.

## Public image

Coldplay's status as a globally recognized pop/rock band has indeed generated a wide range of reactions from both critics and fans. Their extensive following on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram suggests a strong connection with their fans, nurtured by the band's engaging use of videos, letters, and interactive elements like easter eggs and clues in their album releases.

However, not all feedback has been positive. Coldplay has been described as polarizing, eliciting strong positive and negative reactions from music listeners and critics alike. Some, like Alan McGee, have issued negative comments about their music - although he later apologized for his remarks. The New York Times' Jon Pareles famously called Coldplay "the most insufferable band of the decade", citing the precision of their instrumental tracks in X&Y (2005) as a negative point.

Nonetheless, others have defended the band's approach to their music. Idolator's Carl Williott likened their work to Phil Collins' catalog, arguing that while such perfectionism might be considered "corny" at the time, it gains cachet in subsequent eras due to enduring production values and talent. Some critics have even suggested that Coldplay's music is more innovative than it is given credit for, noting their willingness to explore various genres and collaborate with a wide range of artists.

Steven Hyden of Uproxx explained Coldplay's polarizing status by highlighting their emblematic representation of mainstream pop rock, suggesting that their broad appeal and lack of controversy make them an easy target for mockery. In a similar vein, The Independent noted that their generally positive and uncontroversial image could be seen as uninteresting in the modern, outrage-driven online landscape.

However, a New York Times editorial proposed that while Coldplay's image may attract criticism and be labeled as "edgeless" or "corny", their songs will likely endure in the same way as other initially "unhip" artists like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, and ABBA. The longevity of their music suggests that they are "built to endure", regardless of the polarized responses they provoke.

## Legacy

### Accolades and achievements

Coldplay's enormous success and significant impact on the music industry are undeniably impressive. Having sold over 100 million albums globally, they are one of the best-selling artists of all time and widely considered the most successful band of the 21st century.

Among their achievements, they hold records for some of the highest-selling albums in the UK, with three of their records featuring in the top 50 best-selling albums in the country's history. Their song "Viva la Vida" topped both the UK Singles Chart and the Billboard Hot 100 - a feat last achieved by a British group with the Spice Girls' "Wannabe". This track comes from the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, which was the top-selling album of the decade in digital format.

Their influence extends beyond their music, with Forbes naming them the most influential British celebrities in the world in 2013. They were the first band to exceed one billion streams on Spotify and their performance at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show in 2016 attracted the largest audience ever for a group and male act.

Their A Head Full of Dreams Tour, completed in 2017, is one of the highest-grossing tours of all time and in 2022 their touring gross surpassed $1 billion. This places them among an elite group of bands, including Bon Jovi, Eagles, the Rolling Stones, and U2, to have achieved such a milestone.

Coldplay's success is further reflected in the numerous accolades they've received. They hold the record for being the most awarded and nominated group at the Brit Awards. Additionally, they've won seven Grammy Awards, an NRJ Award of Honour, and they've been named Songwriters of the Year at the ASCAP London Music Awards and the Ivor Novello Awards. Their contribution to The Hunger Games: Catching Fire soundtrack earned them nominations at the Critics' Choice Awards and the Academy Awards. They've also received the NME Awards' Godlike Genius Award, which recognizes influential music icons.

The band's financial success is just as impressive, with an estimated combined wealth of over £471 million as of May 2022. Given these achievements, it's clear that Coldplay has left an indelible mark on the global music landscape.

### Cultural impact

Coldplay's impact on the music industry is considerable and far-reaching, extending beyond their own discography to influence other artists, genres, and even areas such as television.

Steve Baltin from Forbes praises them as setting the standard for alternative music, having evolved into one of the finest live bands through consistent performances and adventurous work. According to Sergey Stepanov from Afisha, they have taken on U2's mantle, making alternative rock mainstream, akin to the Beatles' impact in the 20th century.

Coldplay's influence is evident in the success of other bands, such as the Fray, OneRepublic, and Snow Patrol. Their breakthrough single, "Yellow", is considered one of the pivotal songs of the 2000s, influencing the direction of rock music and introducing a unique combination of melancholy and uplift to songwriting. This single is recognized in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" exhibition.

Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, is acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, NME, and Rolling Stone. Its songs "Clocks" and "Fix You" also feature on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.

Coldplay's influence is also acknowledged outside of the music industry. In 2005, they were added to the National Portrait Gallery of London, and in 2018, actress Jodie Whittaker revealed that her costume for the Thirteenth Doctor was partly inspired by the band's album covers.

Their ability to reinvent themselves artistically has resulted in a rich multi-genre legacy and broadened their influence on various artists. Notable figures such as arranger Mattias Bylund, producer Finneas O'Connell, and music director Lee Ji-soo cite Coldplay as an inspiration in their work. Furthermore, their music has influenced diverse genres globally, including sertanejo music in Brazil.

Coldplay's music has been sampled by artists like Drake, Lizzo, Frank Ocean, and Chance the Rapper, and covered by artists like Kelly Clarkson, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, Robyn, Rosé, and Sam Smith.

In summary, Coldplay's influence extends beyond their own success, shaping the musical landscape of the 21st century, and their ability to continually evolve ensures their relevance and impact in an ever-changing music scene.

### Influence on live entertainment

Coldplay has been a game-changer in live performances, pushing the boundaries of what arena rock can be. Felipe Branco Cruz from Veja credits them with redefining the concept of arena rock, by making fans an integral part of the show, a legacy originally set by legendary bands like Pink Floyd, Queen, and U2.

One of the innovative techniques they popularized is the use of interactive LED wristbands in concerts, which have since been adopted by prominent artists including Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and Jay-Z. The creator of these wristbands, Jason Regler, has acknowledged that the idea came to him during a Coldplay concert.

But perhaps one of the most notable contributions from Coldplay is their approach towards environmentally-friendly touring. Their ecological plan proposed during the Music of the Spheres World Tour (2022–24) is considered groundbreaking for a stadium tour. According to Didier Zacharie from Le Soir, Coldplay has laid the groundwork for how future tours can be conducted sustainably. Live Nation's Lucy August-Perna noted that the band has helped develop a framework that will be standardized to provide sustainable touring options for more artists.

Coldplay's influence is also observed in how their practices have impacted tours of other artists, such as Billie Eilish's Happier Than Ever, The World Tour and Shawn Mendes' Wonder: The World Tour.

Their collaboration with John Wiseman (from Worldwide Sales) and Frederic Opsomer (from PRG Projects) for their stage's LED elements led to the creation of new products, such as inflatable three-dimensional orbs, reducing the space needed for storage and transport. Opsomer credits Coldplay for having the vision and audacity to pursue these innovations, predicting that the custom technology developed for the tour will become commonplace in live entertainment in the future.

In summary, Coldplay has not only transformed the concert experience for fans but has also pioneered significant advancements in sustainable touring practices and innovative stage technology. Their influence is setting new standards in the live entertainment industry and shaping future live performances.

## Other activities

### Philanthropy

Coldplay's philanthropic work extends across a wide range of causes and initiatives. The band donates 10% of their profits to charity, a fund that is placed in an account that none of the band members can access.

They endorse over thirty organizations including Amnesty International, Migrant Offshore Aid Station, and Global Citizen Festival. They have released music specifically for charitable purposes, such as a 2003 acoustic cover of "2000 Miles" to raise funds for Stop Handgun Violence and Future Forests, with all proceeds going to the two organizations.

Coldplay has collaborated with various campaigns and movements such as Make Poverty History and they have auctioned significant memorabilia for charity, including Chris Martin's first guitar, the globe from the "[Parachutes](/en/coldplay/parachutes)" album cover, and costumes worn on the Viva la Vida Tour. They are also patrons for ClientEarth, a group of environmental lawyers.

The band performed a modified version of "A Message" (entitled "A Message 2010") at the Hope for Haiti Now telethon, helping raise money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2012, they staged an exhibition with artwork from "Mylo Xyloto" in Camden, raising £610,000 for Kids Company.

Martin contributed his voice to the Band Aid project for a second time in 2014, for a new version of "Do They Know It's Christmas?" aimed at aiding the Ebola crisis in Western Africa. The band also made a significant donation to University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology in 2017, helping to bring "world-leading cancer scientists together under one roof."

In 2018, the band contributed to the Plastic Oceans Album by Artists' Project Earth to raise awareness and funds against plastic pollution. They released Global Citizen – EP 1 under the pseudonym Los Unidades, with royalties going to the organization's efforts of education and advocacy towards the end of extreme poverty.

In 2020, they released a music video for "Trouble in Town" and donated all proceeds from streaming and publishing to the Innocence Project and the African Children's Feeding Scheme. Coldplay also supports the Ocean Cleanup project by sponsoring two watercrafts that collect plastic from polluted rivers in Malaysia.

As part of their efforts to make touring more sustainable, the band partnered with One Tree Planted and funded a tree for each ticket sold during their Music of the Spheres World Tour through a global reforestation agreement.

Finally, according to The Times, they donated over £2.1 million to environmental causes in 2021 through their J Van Mars Foundation. Coldplay's wide-ranging philanthropic efforts demonstrate their deep commitment to a variety of important causes, and their use of their platform to effect change.

### Politics and activism

Coldplay has been actively involved in a range of social and political issues, from fair trade and environmentalism to LGBTQ+ rights and international conflicts.

They supported Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign by collecting over 70,000 signatures during their A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour and Twisted Logic Tour. Vocalist Chris Martin, who resides in the United States, has publicly opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and endorsed Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

The band participates in Paul McCartney's Meat Free Mondays campaign, which promotes reducing meat consumption to combat climate change. They also endorsed the song "Freedom for Palestine" in 2011, leading to controversy and threats of boycott from some fans.

In addition to their environmental and political activism, Coldplay has been a vocal supporter of the LGBTQ+ community. Their Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show ended with rainbow-coloured placards forming the phrase "Believe in Love", drawing accusations from conservative groups of promoting a "gay agenda". However, LGBTQ+ advocacy magazine The Advocate listed the performance among the event's most memorable LGBTQ+ moments.

Coldplay also supported the "Remain" vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, with Martin stating that the Brexit decision did not represent the band's generation or the one following. They participated in the One Love Manchester benefit concert following the Manchester Arena bombing, and were special guests at the Concert for Charlottesville, which supported victims of the Unite the Right rally.

The 2019 album "Everyday Life" saw the band taking a stronger stance against issues like racism, police brutality, and gun violence. In 2021, they were among the artists who signed a public letter endorsing the Equality Act.

Despite opposition from the Malaysian Islamic Party in 2023, due to Martin's practice of waving the pride flag during performances, the band's commitment to their political stances remains firm. Their consistent activism shows that Coldplay utilizes their platform to promote the causes they believe in, in addition to their music.

### Endorsements

Despite their global fame, Coldplay has been notoriously selective about how their music is used in media. They regularly allow their songs to be featured in TV shows and movies, but they have traditionally been strict about forbidding most commercials. In fact, in 2002, they reportedly turned down over $85 million in contracts from brands including Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap. Lead singer Chris Martin expressed that they couldn't bear to sell the meanings of their songs in such a way.

One notable exception came in 2008 when they signed a deal with Apple to promote exclusive availability of the single "Viva la Vida" on iTunes Store. The partnership with Apple continued, with Martin making an appearance at the company's annual special event in 2010, and the band performed at Apple's campus for Steve Jobs' memorial service.

In 2014, they participated in a commercial for Target promoting the exclusive deluxe edition of their album "Ghost Stories". Additionally, the music video for "Adventure of a Lifetime" included product placement for Beats, in exchange for the company covering the budget of the video.

In 2018, the band granted director Jon M. Chu permission to use their song "Yellow" in his film "Crazy Rich Asians" after Chu wrote a heartfelt letter detailing his reasons for wanting to include it. They even approved the commission of a Chinese-language cover of the track for the movie.

In a significant shift from their previous stance, Coldplay announced a major partnership with German multinational BMW in 2021. The partnership aligns with the band's commitment to sustainability, as they praised BMW's recyclable car batteries and renewable energy technology capable of powering live performances. As part of the deal, the band contributed to the marketing of two BMW electric cars and allowed their song "Higher Power" to be used in ads. In 2022, the band selected DHL as their freight partner for their Music of the Spheres World Tour, with the aim to reduce the tour's logistical impact and avoid the use of fossil fuels.
