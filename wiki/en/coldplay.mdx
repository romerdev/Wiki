Following the release of their independent extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. Their debut album, Parachutes (2000), achieved significant success with the breakthrough single "Yellow." The album received several prestigious awards, including a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and a Mercury Prize nomination.

A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), Coldplay's second album, continued their success by winning the same accolades and featuring the hit single "Clocks," which earned a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The band's third album, X&Y (2005), marked the completion of what they considered a trilogy, and their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Both albums topped the charts in over 30 countries and were among the best-selling albums of their respective years. Notably, the title track of Viva la Vida became the first single by a British group in the 21st century to simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States.

Throughout their career, Coldplay has continually evolved their sound across five studio albums, with their most recent release being Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album introduces distinct themes and incorporates various musical styles, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, classical, and progressive rock. The band is renowned for their "euphoric" and "immersive" live performances, described by NME as the moments when they truly come alive and make the most impact. In 2018, a documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in select cinemas to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary.

With a remarkable 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay stands as one of the best-selling music acts in history. They have received numerous accolades, including a record number of Brit Award nominations and wins for a band, ranking them as the sixth-most awarded group according to Fuse. Notable achievements also include having the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three albums among the 50 highest-selling in the United Kingdom, the most number-one albums in the country without missing the top spot, and being the first British group to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

Coldplay's influence extends widely, with Forbes identifying them as the standard for the current alternative music scene and considering them one of the most influential bands of the 21st century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has recognized their impact by including A Rush of Blood to the Head on their "200 Definitive Albums" list, while the single "Yellow" has been featured in the "Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" exhibition for its tremendous success and importance in the music industry. Despite their popularity and influence, Coldplay has garnered a polarizing reputation as music icons.

## History

### Formation and Early Years (1887-1999)

Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland met during their orientation week at University College London in September 1996. They began writing their first songs together in early 1997 and practiced every night. Guy Berryman joined the band in the following months, and they recorded various demos without a drummer, initially calling themselves Big Fat Noises by November. In 1998, Will Champion completed the lineup. He explained that Martin, Buckland, and Berryman had come to his house because a roommate had a drum kit and was a good drummer, but he had not turned up, "so I just said I would give it a go."

Champion scheduled the band's first live performance only a few days after joining. They had not chosen a proper name yet and called themselves Starfish for the show, which was held on January 16, 1998, at The Laurel Tree in Camden. Weeks later, the name Coldplay was settled upon. In May 1998, the band released Safety, an independent EP financed by Martin's lifelong friend, Phil Harvey. Out of 500 copies pressed, 150 went to the open market. Harvey sold the first one to his roommate for £3, and the rest were given away to record labels.

As Martin complained about the influence one of the Camden promoters had on the band, Harvey suggested the group should book their own concert at Dingwalls, where they managed to sell 50 copies of Safety. This event marked the beginning of Harvey managing Coldplay, prompting him to drop out of his Classical Studies degree at Trinity College, Oxford, to work with the band. More concerts were scheduled throughout the summer, including two with Keane. Martin once invited Tim Rice-Oxley to be Coldplay's keyboard player, but "when we discussed it again a couple of weeks later, he said that the rest of the band weren't keen on adding a member." In September 1998, they were part of Manchester's In the City showcase and got discovered by A&R scout Debs Wild. Safety was then followed by a cassette demo with "Ode to Deodorant" and "Brothers & Sisters."

Wild informed BMG Publishing's Caroline Elleray and music lawyer Gavin Maude about the band. Elleray spoke to Dan Keeling at Parlophone, who had previously passed on the opportunity, while Maude spoke to Simon Williams from Fierce Panda Records, who then informed BBC Radio's Steve Lamacq. On January 3, 1999, Coldplay became the first unsigned act to guest on Lamacq's Evening Session. A month later, they made a short deal with Fierce Panda and re-recorded "Brothers & Sisters." As the band's popularity grew, they received contract offers from six other labels, but their preference was Parlophone. This led Elleray to contact Keeling once again, who had now changed his mind, and the deal was signed at Trafalgar Square in April 1999, the same month in which "Brothers & Sisters" was released as a single. In the following days, they balanced studying for UCL's final examinations.

On June 27, 1999, Coldplay made their first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in the New Bands Tent. They later recorded The Blue Room, which had 5,000 copies pressed and sold to the public. Although its sessions were initially meant for Parachutes (2000), they became tumultuous as Martin and Champion had heated discussions regarding the latter's abilities as a drummer. However, they resolved their differences, established a democratic approach within the band, and implemented a set of rules, including the decision to immediately remove anyone using hard drugs, inspired by acts like R.E.M. and U2.

### 2000-2001: Parachutes

The band initially planned to record their debut album, Parachutes, within two weeks. However, due to their busy touring schedule, the recording process took place between September 1999 and April–May 2000. The album was primarily recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios, with producer Ken Nelson. Most of the tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios, utilizing three studio rooms. The songs were mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. During this period, Coldplay performed on the Carling Tour, which highlighted emerging artists.

After releasing two EPs without a hit song, Coldplay achieved their first Top 40 hit with the lead single from Parachutes, "Shiver," released in March 2000. It coincided with their performance at The Forum in Tunbridge Wells, supporting the band Terris as part of the NME Premier Tour. "Shiver" reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. In June 2000, Coldplay embarked on their first headlining tour, which included a performance at the Glastonbury Festival. They also released the single "Yellow," their first release to enter the top five, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. The music video for "Yellow," shot at Studland Bay in Dorset, featured Martin singing the song in one continuous shot as he walked along the beach. Both "Yellow" and "Shiver" were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000. In the United States, "Yellow" served as the lead single from the then-untitled debut album and was sent to college and alternative radio outlets in October 2000.

Parachutes was released on July 10, 2000, in the United Kingdom via Parlophone, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was released on November 7, 2000, in North America by Nettwerk Records. The album was released in various formats, including CD releases by Parlophone and Nettwerk in 2000, a cassette release by US label Capitol in 2001, and an LP release by Parlophone in the following year. Four singles were released from Parachutes, including "Shiver" and "Yellow," which gained popularity in both the UK and the US. The third single, "Trouble," reached number 10 on the UK charts and was released in the US over a year later, peaking at number 28 on the Alternative Songs chart. In December 2001, Coldplay released a limited-edition CD titled Mince Spies, featuring a remix of "Yellow" and the Christmas song "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." Only 1,000 copies were pressed, and it was exclusively distributed to fans and journalists.

In September 2000, Parachutes received a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize. After achieving success in Europe, Coldplay turned their focus to North America, releasing the album there in November 2000 and embarking on the US Club Tour in February 2001. At the 2001 Brit Awards, Coldplay won awards for Best British Group and Best British Album. Although Parachutes had a slow start in the United States, it eventually achieved double-platinum status. The album received critical acclaim and was honored with the Best Alternative Music Album award at the 2002 Grammy Awards. Chris Martin expressed that the success of Parachutes aimed to elevate the band's status as the "biggest, best band in the world". In early 2001, after single-handedly managing the band, Harvey resigned from his managerial duties due to the stress involved and assumed the role of the group's creative director. He is often referred to as their fifth member. Dave Holmes took over as the band's manager.

### 2002–2004: A Rush of Blood to the Head

Following the success of Parachutes, Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin working on their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, once again with producer Ken Nelson. However, they faced difficulties focusing in London and decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had previously recorded some songs for Parachutes. In Liverpool, vocalist Chris Martin mentioned their obsession with recording. The album's lead single, "In My Place," was the first song recorded for the album. It played a significant role in inspiring the band to embark on creating their second album after a period of uncertainty following the success of Parachutes. Martin stated, "One thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming."

During the album's production, the band composed over 20 songs, some of which, including "In My Place" and "Animals," were performed live while still touring for Parachutes. The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website. A Rush of Blood to the Head was released in August 2002 and spawned several popular singles, such as "In My Place," "Clocks," and the heartfelt ballad "The Scientist." The inspiration for "The Scientist" came from George Harrison's 1970 song "All Things Must Pass."

From June 19, 2002, to September 8, 2003, Coldplay embarked on the A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour, covering five continents and including co-headlining festival performances at Glastonbury Festival, V2003, and Rock Werchter. Their concerts featured captivating lighting and individualized screens reminiscent of U2's Elevation Tour and Nine Inch Nails' Fragility Tour. Throughout the extensive tour, Coldplay recorded a live DVD and CD, Live 2003, at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion.

At the 2003 Brit Awards held in London's Earls Court, Coldplay received awards for Best British Group and Best British Album. On August 28, 2003, they performed "The Scientist" at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, where they won three awards.

In December 2003, Coldplay was chosen by readers of Rolling Stone magazine as the best artist and band of the year. During that time, the band released a cover of the Pretenders' 1983 song "2000 Miles" as a download on their official website. "2000 Miles" became the top-selling UK download of that year, with proceeds from sales donated to the Future Forests and Stop Handgun Violence campaigns. A Rush of Blood to the Head received the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Coldplay's "Clocks" earned the Record of the Year honor.

### 2005–2007: X&Y

After a hiatus from touring, Coldplay released a satire music video for a fictional band called The Nappies while focusing on recording their third album in 2004. X&Y was eventually released in June 2005 in the UK and Europe. However, the album's delayed release date caused it to fall into the next fiscal year, which was attributed to a drop in EMI's stock. Nevertheless, X&Y went on to become the best-selling album of 2005 with worldwide sales of 8.3 million copies.

The album's lead single, "Speed of Sound," made its debut on radio and online music stores on April 18, 2005, and was released as a CD on May 23, 2005. X&Y achieved the number one position on the album charts of 20 countries and became the third-fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Two additional singles, "Fix You" in September and "Talk" in December, were also released that year.

While critical reaction to X&Y was generally positive, it received slightly less enthusiasm compared to its predecessor. The New York Times critic Jon Pareles famously described Coldplay as "the most insufferable band of the decade," while NME awarded the album a rating of 9/10, praising its confidence, ambition, and abundance of singles. Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became commonplace during this time. Chris Martin, the band's vocalist, expressed that the critical review by the New York Times was liberating as he agreed with some of the points made, finding it validating to see that someone else shared similar thoughts.

From June 2005 to March 2007, Coldplay embarked on their Twisted Logic Tour, which included performances at festivals like Coachella, Isle of Wight Festival, Glastonbury, and the Austin City Limits Music Festival. They also appeared at Live 8 in Hyde Park in July 2005, where they collaborated with Richard Ashcroft on vocals for a rendition of the Verve's "Bitter Sweet Symphony." Coldplay performed "Speed of Sound" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami on August 28. In September, they recorded a new version of "How You See the World" with reworked lyrics for War Child's Help!: A Day in the Life charity album. At the Brit Awards in February 2006, Coldplay received honors for Best Album and Best Single. Three more singles, "The Hardest Part," "What If," and "White Shadows," were released in 2006 and 2007.

### 2008–2010: Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends

In October 2006, Coldplay began working on their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, with producer Brian Eno. During this time, the band took a break from recording and toured Latin America, concluding their Twisted Logic Tour with performances in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. The album's sound was influenced by their experiences touring in Latin America and Spain, with the band recording in churches and other venues. Viva la Vida represented a new direction for Coldplay, departing from their previous trilogy of albums. Vocalist Chris Martin showcased his lower register more prominently, and the album featured songs like "Violet Hill" with distorted guitar riffs and bluesy undertones.

"Violet Hill" was chosen as the album's first single and received widespread acclaim. It entered the charts in the UK Top 10, US Top 40, and other countries around the world. The title track, "Viva la Vida," was exclusively released on iTunes and became Coldplay's first number-one single on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Official Charts. The band performed "Viva la Vida" live for the first time at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards and the song became iTunes' best-selling song of 2008.

Upon its release, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends became a worldwide chart-topper and the best-selling album of 2008. It quickly climbed to number one on the UK album chart, selling 302,000 copies within three days of release. The album also set a record for the most-downloaded album ever by the end of June. Coldplay received accolades for the album, winning two Q Awards and being named the World's Best-selling Act of 2008 at the World Music Awards.

Coldplay embarked on the Viva la Vida Tour in June, which kicked off with a free concert at Brixton Academy in London. They also performed at the Sound Relief benefit concert in Australia and headlined a sold-out show the same night. In 2009, Coldplay faced a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Joe Satriani, alleging that their song "Viva la Vida" included substantial portions of his song "If I Could Fly." The band denied the allegation, and an undisclosed settlement was eventually reached.

During this period, Coldplay won several awards, including Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Rock Album. They also released a live album titled LeftRightLeftRightLeft, which was recorded during the tour and made available as a free download. Coldplay continued touring, announcing a Latin America tour for February and March 2010. They received further recognition, including Song of the Year at the ASCAP Awards and being ranked as one of the best artists of the 2000s by Rolling Stone readers. In December 2010, the band released "Christmas Lights," a song praised by critics, accompanied by a music video featuring a cameo from actor Simon Pegg.

### 2011–2012: Mylo Xyloto

During the years 2011 and 2012, Coldplay released their fifth studio album titled "Mylo Xyloto." The band completed the recording of the album in mid-2011. In interviews, Chris Martin described the lyrical themes of the album, which included love, addiction, OCD, escapism, and working for someone you dislike. Coldplay confirmed several festival appearances before the album's release, including headlining spots at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Rock in Rio, and Lollapalooza.

Two new songs, "Princess of China" and "Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall," were mentioned by the band in interviews and were included on the upcoming album. "Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall" was announced as the album's first single and released in June 2011. Throughout the summer, Coldplay presented several new songs from the album, such as "Charlie Brown," "Hurts Like Heaven," "Us Against the World," "Princess of China," and "Major Minus," during their festival performances.

On August 12, 2011, Coldplay revealed that the album would be titled "Mylo Xyloto" and would be released on October 24, 2011. They released the second single, "Paradise," on September 12, and tickets for their European tour went on sale on September 23, selling out quickly. "Mylo Xyloto" received mixed to positive reviews upon its release but achieved chart success in over 34 countries.

In October 2011, Coldplay performed at Apple Inc.'s private memorial for Steve Jobs, and their concert at the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas in Madrid was streamed live on YouTube. They received three Grammy Award nominations for the 54th Annual Grammy Awards and performed with Rihanna at the ceremony. Coldplay also won the Brit Award for Best British Group for the third time.

The album "Mylo Xyloto" was the best-selling rock album in the UK, selling 908,000 copies, and its second single, "Paradise," was the best-selling rock single in the UK, selling 410,000 copies. The album has sold over 8 million copies worldwide. Coldplay headlined the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Paralympic Games, and a concert documentary film and live album titled "Coldplay Live 2012" documented their tour in support of the "Mylo Xyloto" album.

After the Mylo Xyloto Tour concluded with two shows featuring Jay-Z in New York, Coldplay hinted at taking a three-year break from touring. The tour was highly successful, ranking as the fourth-highest-grossing tour worldwide of 2012, earning over $171.3 million in ticket sales.

### 2013–2014: Ghost Stories

In an interview with Australian radio station 2Day FM, Chris Martin revealed that the title for the band's next album would be "much easier to pronounce".[148] Martin debunked speculation that they were taking a break from touring by saying, "This three-year break idea only came about because I said at a gig in Australia that we might not be back there for three years. That's probably true, but that's just how a world tour works. No chance are we taking a three-year break."[149]

On 9 August 2013, Coldplay announced the release of their song "Atlas", which featured on the soundtrack for the film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.[150] Its release got pushed back to 6 September 2013 (everywhere but the UK) and 8 September (UK). In December 2013, it was announced that future Coldplay releases would be distributed by Atlantic Records in the US due to restructuring within Warner Music Group following the purchase of Parlophone Records from EMI.[151]

On 25 February 2014, the band unveiled "Midnight", a track from their yet-to-be released album.[152] In early March 2014, it was announced that the band's sixth album, Ghost Stories, would be released 19 May 2014.[153] Ghost Stories is a spiritually driven album that revolves around two major themes mentioned by Chris Martin. The album explores the idea of past actions, and the effects they can have on your future and one's capacity for unconditional love.[154] The band took a different approach for their sixth studio album in contrast to their previous studio albums, with Martin inviting the band to contribute original songwriting material for the album, as opposed to building songs off his ideas as they had done during previous recording sessions.[155]

From April to July, Coldplay embarked on a six-date Ghost Stories Tour in support of the album, playing 'intimate' shows in six cities: the Beacon Theatre in New York City on 5 May, Royce Hall in Los Angeles on 19 May, Casino de Paris in Paris on 28 May, Tokyo Dome City Hall in Tokyo on 12 June, Enmore Theatre in Sydney on 19 June, and closed the tour at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 2 July 2014.[156] The album was made available for pre-order on iTunes, alongside new single "Magic".[157] Two more singles from the album, "A Sky Full of Stars" and "True Love", have since been released. Ghost Stories received mixed to positive reviews.[158] The album topped the charts in the UK, the US and most major markets.[159][160] It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, and "A Sky Full of Stars" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.[161] In December 2014, Spotify named Coldplay the most-streamed band in the world for 2014, and third most-streamed artist behind Ed Sheeran and Eminem.[162]

### 2015–2018: A Head Full of Dreams

On 4 December 2014, Chris Martin announced in an interview with Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 that Coldplay were in the middle of working on their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams.[163][164] Martin remarked it might be the band's final album and compared it to Harry Potter: "It's our seventh thing, and the way we look at it, it's like the last Harry Potter book or something like that."[165] He added that unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record.[165] In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band were trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will be something to "shuffle your feet" to.[166]

On 11 December 2014, the band unveiled a new song, "Miracles", which was written and recorded for the World War II drama film Unbroken directed by Angelina Jolie.[167] At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards on 17 May, Ghost Stories was named Top Rock Album.[168] On 26 September, Coldplay performed at the 2015 Global Citizen Festival in Central Park's Great Lawn in New York, an event organised by Chris Martin advocating for an end to extreme global poverty.[169] Coldplay, along with Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran, and Pearl Jam, headlined the festival which was broadcast on NBC in the US on 27 September and the BBC in the UK on 28 September.[169]

Speaking on Nick Grimshaw's Radio 1 Breakfast Show on the BBC on 6 November, Coldplay confirmed 4 December as the release date of A Head Full of Dreams, and a new song from the album, "Adventure of a Lifetime" premiered on the show.[170] The album has guest appearances from Beyoncé, Gwyneth Paltrow, Noel Gallagher, Tove Lo and Barack Obama.[170] The album reached number one in the UK, and number two in the US, Australia and Canada among others where it was kept in second place by Adele's 25.[171][172] The music video for "Adventure of a Lifetime" featured the band performing as chimpanzees. They were provided consultation with renowned performance capture actor Andy Serkis.[173]

On 27 November 2015, the first dates to their 2016 A Head Full of Dreams Tour were announced. Latin American and European stops were listed, which included three dates at Wembley Stadium, London in June.[174] The North America Tour, an extra Wembley concert, and an Oceania tour were later added. On 5 December, the band headlined the opening day of the 2015 Jingle Bell Ball at London's O2 Arena.[175] On 7 February 2016 they headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show,[176] being joined by Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.[177] In April 2016, the band were named the sixth best-selling artist worldwide in 2015.[178]

On 26 June 2016, Coldplay closed the final day of the Glastonbury Festival in England. Their performance included a duet with Barry Gibb, the last surviving member of the Bee Gees.[179] During the band's second night at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on 18 July, Coldplay were joined onstage by Michael J. Fox to recreate a Back to the Future scene. Martin sang "Earth Angel" before introducing Fox onstage to join the band in performing the Chuck Berry classic "Johnny B. Goode".[180]

The band performed a full set in India for the first time as part of the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai on 19 November 2016. This performance was attended by 80,000 people and also featured many Bollywood stars during the concert.[181][182] The same month, Coldplay announced in interviews with Absolute Radio and Magic Radio in London that they would be releasing new songs in a new EP called the Kaleidoscope EP. Described as being made from a leftover "bag of ideas" from the recording of A Head Full of Dreams, Martin stated that it would be released in "a couple of months".[183] The band officially announced that the EP was released on 14 July 2017.[184]

On 22 February 2017, the band released a long-awaited and teased collaboration track with EDM duo The Chainsmokers called "Something Just Like This".

Martin stated that the proceeds from the song and concert would be donated to relief efforts for Mexico and other countries.[189]

The A Head Full of Dreams Tour was finished in November 2017. Grossing over $523 million, in 2017 it was listed as the third-highest-grossing concert tour of all time.[190] The promised live album, which is titled Live in Buenos Aires, came out on 7 December 2018.

Martin had earlier said that the band would not tour to promote the album until they could work out "how our tour can not only be sustainable (but) how can it be actively beneficial", and hope that it would be entirely carbon-neutral.[200] However, Coldplay performed a one-off show on 25 November 2019 for the charity ClientEarth at London's Natural History Museum. The band played beneath Hope, a giant 128-year-old skeleton of a blue whale in the museum's great hall.[201] The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 81,000 copies sold, making it the band's eighth consecutive UK number-one album. It was also the third fastest-selling album of 2019, behind No.6 Collaborations Project and Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent.[202] On 24 November 2020, Coldplay received two nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, with one of them being Album of the Year, their first nomination in the category since Viva la Vida.[203] On 21 December 2020, "Flags" was released internationally, the song was originally included as a Japanese bonus track of Everyday Life.[204]

### 2021–present: Music of the Spheres

On 29 April 2021, Coldplay announced a new single called "Higher Power" to be released on 7 May 2021 with a video livestream coinciding with the release of the single to be aired from the International Space Station.[205][206] Chris Martin stated in an interview with Zane Lowe that the band would be working with Max Martin and his team on both the song and the new album. He said, "Max is our producer right now for everything we do".[207] On 4 May 2021, Coldplay were announced as the opening act for the 2021 Brit Awards, where they would be performing "Higher Power".[208]

On 22 May 2021, their pre-recorded performance at Glastonbury Festival was broadcast online.[209] The band also showcased a new song called "Human Heart", featuring R&B duo We Are King.[210] On 8 June 2021, the "official" music video for "Higher Power", directed by Dave Meyers, premiered on YouTube, following a simpler music video featuring the band performing the song while dancing with CGI alien holograms that premiered on 7 May 2021.[211] On 20 July 2021, Coldplay announced that their new album Music of the Spheres would be released on 15 October 2021, and also announced a track titled "Coloratura", which was released 23 July 2021.[212]

On 13 September 2021, they announced with South Korean pop group BTS the second single, "My Universe", which was released on 24 September 2021.[213] The song debuted at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, being their highest-peaking single since "Something Just Like This"[214] and debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[215] A short documentary about the collaboration with BTS was later released on 26 September 2021 on the official BTS YouTube channel.[216]

Music of the Spheres debuted at number one the UK Albums Chart,[217] becoming the fastest-selling album in the country since Ed Sheeran's 2019 No.6 Collaborations Project.[218] The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart,[219] and reached number one on both the Top Alternative Albums and the Top Rock Albums charts.[220] On 14 October 2021, Coldplay announced their eighth concert tour, the Music of the Spheres World Tour, which began in San José, Costa Rica, in March 2022 and will visit three continents, with more tour dates to be announced in the future.[221] The tour is part of an ongoing effort to reduce the band's carbon footprint; Chris Martin explained in an interview with BBC that the tour would feature "kinetic flooring" that powers the concerts through the movement of concertgoers, as well as bicycles that do the same thing, meaning that "the whole show is powered from renewable energy". Martin said the band's goal is that they will have "slightly shifted the status quo of how a tour works".[222] On 23 November 2021, "Higher Power" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[223] In December 2021, Martin said Coldplay would release three more albums until 2025 during an interview for BBC, with one of them being "kind of a musical" while their last will be a "back to the basics" self-titled record.[224] He added, however, that the band will still be active with smaller releases and worldwide touring after 2025.[225] On 23 February 2022, the band released a new stripped-down version of "Let Somebody Go", and a cover of Kid Cudi's 2008 single "Day 'n' Nite". Both songs were part of their Spotify Singles release.[226] The album received three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards announced on 15 November 2022, including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, with "My Universe" being nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.[227]

## Artistry

### Creative progress

During an interview for NME, Berryman explained the band usually have a title and concept in mind before the music arrives, which serves to provide a "framework into which we can work thematically".[228] Martin described their way of writing new songs as "a series of doors".[229] He brings initial ideas to Buckland and the guitarist either disapproves or gives his input; the same happens from Buckland to Berryman, then Champion, allowing all band members to express themselves artistically.[229] However, this process is known to not always be linear, as tracks like "Magic" and "Adventure of a Lifetime" were started through the bass and guitar riffs from Berryman and Buckland, respectively.[230] Coldplay regularly switch instruments while in the studio as well.[231] When questioned about avoiding explicit language in lyrics, Champion affirmed swear words are "extremely useful at times", but overusing them "lessens their impact".[229] Moreover, music critics claim the band have a pattern which alternates between "overt bids for mainstream success and more self-consciously artsy prestige pieces".[232] Buckland stated knowing the "big [album] is coming allows us to go a lot smaller" and be more "insular about what music we make sense".[228]

### Musical and lyrical style

Coldplay have explored many musical styles throughout their career, with their sound being considered alternative rock,[233] alternative pop,[234] pop rock,[235] post-Britpop,[236] soft rock,[237] and pop.[238] After winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2009, Martin jokingly stated in his acceptance speech that they were "limestone rock", in comparison to "hard rock".[239] The extended plays released in 1998 and 1999 have characteristics of dream pop, setting them apart from future releases.[240] Their first studio album, Parachutes (2000), was described as "melodic pop" which combined "bits of distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion", being "exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive".[241] Berryman called it "a quiet, polite record",[242] while Champion compared the lyrics to Lou Reed's "Perfect Day", as they are "quite moody" but with "twists that imply optimism", ultimately creating an album defined by the contrast between "beautiful and happy" messages and "really, really sad" sounds.[243]

On the other hand, 2002's A Rush of Blood to the Head is full of "plaintive strums, weary arpeggios and pained melodies", along with a sense of urgency and heartbreak.[244] During an interview, Martin affirmed the title means "doing something on impulse".[244] Music critics described it as larger,[245] darker, and colder than its predecessor,[246] praising Coldplay for showing a "newfound confidence" as well.[247] This style was kept for their third album, X&Y (2005),[248] although with the addition of electronic influences and extensive use of synthesisers,[249] having a grander scale in terms of both sound and existential themes.[250] Craig McLean from The Guardian called it "the work of an increasingly driven, punchier band", describing the melodies as "heartfelt stuff, with thumping guitar lines and emotive piano".[242] Lyrics from the record have been considered "ruminations on Martin's doubts, fears, hopes, and loves", with words that "are earnest and vague, so listeners can identify with the underlying concepts in the songs".[251] Kevin Devine from Hybrid Magazine wrote that Buckland's "gleaming guitar sound gives X&Y a euphonic radiance", and thematically, the album contains a "running thread of importance of trying, as well as the need for basic communication amongst the cacophony of confusion in the world".[248]

With Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and the subsequent Prospekt's March (both released in 2008), Coldplay further diversified their style and explored new territory following the completion of what they saw as a trilogy of albums.[252] The band experimented with numerous different instruments,[253] including electric violins, tack pianos, santoors and orchestras, all while using more layered productions.[254] They also tried distinct song structures and vocal identities at the suggestion of producer Brian Eno,[255] drawing influences from oriental, Hispanic, African, and Middle Eastern sounds.[252] The title track, "Viva la Vida", is considered baroque pop and fourth single "Strawberry Swing" was described as having psychedelic inspirations.[256] They dabbled in shoegaze on hidden track "Chinese Sleep Chant" as well.[257] Lyrics are more universal in comparison to previous material, with the subject matter being more collective as the band "delves into love, life, war and death".[258] Martin commented the revolution motifs were inspired by Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables (1862).[259]

Those themes, along with some of the oriental influences, remained in 2011's Mylo Xyloto,[260] a concept album that follows the story of two characters in the style of a rock opera.[261] It expanded the spectrum of Coldplay's sound by including more electronic elements than before and featuring mostly upbeat tones for the first time, resulting in a pop rock style with "modern, urban and dance" melodies.[261] According to Champion, the band originally wanted to make an acoustic record, so when "Paradise" started to take shape, they decided to begin a separate electronic album. However, the two of them ultimately became a single body of work, with songs like "Charlie Brown" and "Us Against the World" getting reworked into their current versions.[262] Berryman affirmed they approached the project with "a lot of confidence".[261] Lyrically, Martin said he was inspired by old school American graffiti, the White Rose movement, and "being able to speak out or follow your passion, even if everybody seems against it".[263] In 2013, a comic book based on the record's plot was released in partnership with Mark Osborne.[264]

For Ghost Stories (2014), Coldplay adopted a melancholic and somber style considered reminiscent of their debut,[265] while incorporating electronica,[266] R&B,[267] synth-pop and ambient influences.[268] Its melodies are also noticeably darker and more minimalistic than Mylo Xyloto,[269] having sparse arrangements that reflect their desire to "keep a sense of space" without "being afraid of silence" or "layering too many sounds".[270] The project is considered a break-up album as well,[271] exploring lyrically how past events in one's life (their ghosts) affect the present. Martin called it a "journey of learning about unconditional love" after his divorce from Gwyneth Paltrow.[272] A year later, A Head Full of Dreams was released with a similar style, but featuring bright and uplifting tones instead,[273] making contrast with its predecessor while introducing elements of disco and funk, most notably in lead single "Adventure of a Lifetime".[274] In the lyrics, they worked on subjects of unity, dreaming, parenthood, forgiveness, healing, and thankfulness.[273]

In 2017, the band made Kaleidoscope EP available as a companion piece to the album.[275] It included a live version of "Something Just Like This", their EDM collaboration with the Chainsmokers, and Brian Eno's returning production in "Aliens".[275] Meanwhile, tracks such as "All I Can Think About Is You" and "Hypnotised" mixed Coldplay's newfound pop style with their alternative rock roots,[276] setting the template for Everyday Life (2019), which saw a return to the experimentation and organic sounds of Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends while having new influences from gospel, blues and classical music.[277] Released as the lead single along with "Orphans", the song "Arabesque" drew from jazz fusion and afrobeat inspirations.[278] The band continued their lyrical themes of positivity, equality, hope, legacy and humanity, but added loss, pain and commentaries on political and social issues such as racism, police brutality, gun control and refugee crisis, being their first album with profanity.[279]

This multi-style approach was similarly present in 2021's Music of the Spheres, although leaning towards pop sounds.[280] According to Berryman, the album "was created with one eye on the live performances" and that "shaped the overall energy levels and song selections" for it.[281] Martin added he was inspired by the Star Wars franchise, which made him wonder what other artists could be like across the universe after watching the Mos Eisley Cantina band perform.[282] New musical influences include "Human Heart" and "Coloratura"; the former is an a cappella collaboration with R&B duo We Are King and Jacob Collier,[283] while the latter is a progressive rock ballad running at 10 minutes and 18 seconds, making it the longest song the band have released.[284] The phrase "Everyone is an alien somewhere" was frequently used to promote the project, Champion stated it is meant to get people to look at what brings them together instead of what keeps them apart, since "from another planet's perspective, we would be the aliens".[285]

### Influences

Coldplay's music has been compared to A-ha, U2, Oasis, R.E.M. and Radiohead.[286] They acknowledged Scottish band Travis and American singer Jeff Buckley as major influences on their early material as well,[287] which was mostly produced by Ken Nelson.[288] Martin is known to be a fan of Bruce Springsteen,[289] mentioned "spending three years trying to sound like Eddie Vedder" before Buckley,[255] and commented listening to many hymns when he was young due to his religious upbringing. In 2021, he cited Belgian singer-songwriter Stromae as another influence, affirming "He is one of our heroes you know, he is one of those people that comes along and completely inspires you all over again".[290]

Buckland, on the other hand, stated the Stone Roses were one of the reasons why he learned to play guitar.[291] In 2020, he shared on social media playlists with some of his favorite tracks and artists from each decade, including the Velvet Underground, Carole King, Joy Division, Talking Heads, Kate Bush, Donna Summer, Björk, Beastie Boys and many others.[292] He said during an interview in the following year his favorite song of all time is "Teardrop" by Massive Attack.[293] Meanwhile, Berryman is known to be inspired by artists like James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Kool & the Gang and the Funk Brothers.[294] He further added that his musical taste is "hard to condense it down" but "could not live without the Beatles or Motown".[295] As for Champion, he commented knowing how to play violin and piano since he was eight years old gave him a different perspective on drums, which he only learned to play after joining the band.[296] During his youth, he listened to Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Nick Cave and traditional Irish folk music.[297] He has named Ginger Baker, Dave Grohl and John Bonham as some of his favorite drummers.[298]

For A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), they drew inspiration from Echo & the Bunnymen,[299] George Harrison,[300] and Muse.[301] Their third album, X&Y (2005), was particularly influenced by Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and Johnny Cash.[302] The song "Til Kingdom Come" was originally written as a collaboration with the latter before he died.[302] Aside from Nelson, the band also worked with Danton Supple in the recording sessions.[303] In 2008's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, Coldplay's style moved towards art rock, being inspired by My Bloody Valentine, Blur and Arcade Fire.[304] After partnering with Brian Eno and Jon Hopkins, they began to incorporate elements of ambient music and electronica into their compositions.[305] The two producers returned in Mylo Xyloto (2011), with the former having a more direct role by helping to write the songs.[306]

In 2014, Paul Epworth contributed for Ghost Stories.[307] Producers Tim Bergling and Madeon were involved as well,[308] which resulted in tracks like "A Sky Full of Stars" having a more "danceable flavor".[309] Made available in the following year, A Head Full of Dreams (2015) featured producing duo Stargate.[310] Long-time partners of the band include Davide Rossi,[311] Bill Rakho, Rik Simpson and Dan Green.[312] The last three are referred as The Dream Team on Everyday Life (2019) and all four have been working with Coldplay since Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.[312] For their ninth album, Music of the Spheres (2021), the group invited Swedish producer Max Martin.[313] The song "People of the Pride" has an introduction inspired by a Beyoncé performance at the Global Citizen Festival,[314] while promotional single "Coloratura" drew comparisons to Pink Floyd.[284]

### Live performances

Coldplay are known to "make sure each tour is its own dazzling, light-up spectacular",[316] with their visual shows making use of lasers, fireworks, confetti cannons and interactive LED wristbands.[317] The latter is considered a signature piece of their performances as the band is credited with popularizing its use.[318] When reviewing Live in Buenos Aires (2018), Sam Sodomsky from Pitchfork stated that it "makes a strong case for the legacy of one of the 21st century's most enduring live acts",[316] a perspective echoed by The Guardian's Alexis Petridis after describing the band's setlists as "a bullish reminder of how [they] got, and then stayed, huge".[319] Both reviewers also commented on how Martin often interacts with the public between each song's performance.

For Ghost Stories Tour (2014), however, they performed intimate sets at venues like Royal Albert Hall and the Beacon Theatre.[320] The concerts made use of new features including a laser harp and the reactable.[321] A similar approach was taken for Everyday Life (2019) over their environmental concerns,[322] with the band playing small shows for charity and a special livestream at the Amman Citadel in Jordan.[323] When reviewing the latter, Dan Stubbs from NME concluded "on stage is where Coldplay come alive, and where they make the most sense".[5] In 2022, Champion said the Flaming Lips were instrumental in shaping their idea of how entertaining a concert can be, as the American band's tours have "a sense of wonder and sense of fun which we really respond to".[324]

### Fashion and aesthetic

While members of the band dress casually in their personal lives,[325] they have adopted multiple styles and visuals for each album's promotion.[326] James Hall, from The Telegraph, described Coldplay's initial years, Parachutes (2000) and A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) looks as "skinny indie kids".[326] Martin was also seen wearing Make Trade Fair shirts and had multiple versions of the institution's logo written on the back of his hand.[327] In the marketing campaign for X&Y (2005), which featured a representation of the Baudot code on its artwork,[328] the group wore black shirts, jackets, suits and pants, accompanied by white shoes.[242] After being questioned about it, the singer commented there was a "great security in looking over at [Buckland] and seeing he's wearing the same coloured shoes as me. I suppose it's the same reason why the army wears a uniform, so that you feel part of a clan. And when we are all dressed that way, I just feel very much like [everything] is OK, because I am part of this team".[242]

Since 2007, the band have been working with stylist Beth Fenton in every project to make clothes "fit the universe or the story" being told.[329] They met her through Stella McCartney and Sara Jowett, who also helped Coldplay to create hand-painted and "vintage-sourced" uniforms for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008).[329] Inspirations included the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and military jackets worn by French Revolution armies.[330] The piece Martin used at Wembley Stadium in 2009 was added to the V&A Museum permanent collection as well.[331] During recording sessions for Mylo Xyloto (2011), the band drew influence from grafitti and designed instruments, cover artworks and stages with street artist Paris.[332] Conversely, Mila Fürstová's melancholic etchings were extensively adopted for Ghost Stories (2014).[333] Mythical and natural motifs served as the creative drive.[333] Non-customised outfits returned, but priority was given to darker tones.[334]

Around the same period, Martin started to wear buttons from Love Button Global Movement, which became his signature accessory.[335] The organization is focused on transforming the world through individual and collaborative "acts of kindness".[336] Clothes made for A Head Full of Dreams (2015) then included details based on tie-dye and kaleidoscope visuals reminiscent of the 1970s decade.[337] Berryman's jacket and shirts worn by Buckland and Champion also had the flower of life as a reference to the album cover,[338] while Martin drew media attention for using custom-made Air Jordans.[339] Additionally, instruments were decorated with stickers, some of which featured the names of the band's children.[338] In 2016, Fenton stated Coldplay's pieces are typically sourced from Rag & Bone and Levi's.[339] Three years later, a photograph of Buckland's great-grandfather spawned the old-fashioned imagery of Everyday Life (2019),[340] characterized as "a sepia-tinged 1919 jazz band".[326] Nods to the Arab world were prominently made as well.[340] To promote Music of the Spheres (2021), they incorporated a "cosmic" edge to all items and photoshoots.[326] Moreover, wardrobe pieces were provided by Applied Art Forms, a fashion label Berryman founded in the previous year.[341] He works as its designer and takes inspiration in utilitarian, workwear, and military clothing.[342]

## Public image

Coldplay are considered polarizing pop/rock icons,[343] having received both praise and criticism from music reviewers as well as the public.[344] They maintain a close relationship with fans through videos, letters and social media interactions,[345] becoming the third and sixth-most-followed band in the world on Twitter and Instagram, respectively.[346] They are also known to tease upcoming releases by spreading easter eggs and clues around the world.[347] In a survey published by the Daily Mirror listing the most popular and unpopular artists in the United Kingdom, Coldplay were among the 20 most-voted acts on both lists; the only other bands with the same distinction were ABBA and U2.[348] In July 2000, Alan McGee described their songs as "bedwetters music", to which Buckland responded: "We are trying to be who we are, you know. Pretending to be 'a bit mad' would just be sad".[349] McGee apologised for the comment two decades later, saying, "I don't like their music but I don't think they are that bad".[349]

Jon Pareles from The New York Times named Coldplay "the most insufferable band of the decade", describing X&Y (2005) as "faultless to a fault, with instrumental tracks purged of any glimmer of human frailty".[350] In 2015, Idolator's Carl Williott compared it to the works of Phil Collins, noting "such perfectionism is always considered corny in its time", but have cachet in subsequent eras "because the production values, songcraft and sheer talent stood the test of time".[351] They were accused of "sticking to a formula" as well,[352] to which some music critics have answered that even though Coldplay "never totally break out from the conventions of a genre", they do "travel" between them.[353] Furthermore, while writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas affirmed that "from genre-spanning albums to collaborating with Brian Eno and Beyoncé, they are far more radical than people give them credit for",[354] a sentiment echoed by NME's Charlotte Krol while reviewing Everyday Life (2019).[279]

Steven Hyden from Uproxx stated Coldplay "will always be an irresistible target for a certain kind of person" because "they epitomise mainstream pop rock more than any other act from the past twenty years", adding "mainstream bands are the easiest music entities to mock" and how "it is presumed that there is nothing to 'get' with this band", but "if that was actually true, they wouldn't be so polarizing".[355] Similarly, The Independent commented they are "often positive, distinctly uncontroversial and inoffensive" while "in the modern world (especially online), if you're not causing outrage you may as well not exist".[356] In a special editorial named "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", The New York Times selected "Hymn for the Weekend" and concluded that Coldplay's "brand of wide-screen pop attracts easy put-downs" such as "edgeless" and "corny", but "like Phil Collins, Michael McDonald, ABBA or any number of desperately 'unhip' artists, their image will evaporate while their songs will weather the years", as the band is "built to endure".[357]

## Legacy

### Accolades and achievements

Coldplay are considered the most successful band of the 21st century.[358] With over 100 million albums sold globally, they are one of the best-selling artists of all time.[b] Parachutes (2000), A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and X&Y (2005) have all been listed among the 50 best-selling albums of United Kingdom's history, marking the most appearances by a group in the ranking.[359] The latter was the third-fastest-selling record ever in the country upon release.[360] In 2008, "Viva la Vida" became the first British group song to top both UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot 100 since "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls.[361] Its parent album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, was the best-selling of the decade in digital download formats.[362] In 2013, Coldplay were named the most influential British celebrities in the world by Forbes.[363] The following year saw them become the first band in history to surpass one billion streams on Spotify.[364] Their performance at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show in 2016 earned the biggest audience ever for a group and male act,[365] with the event's impact making them the year's most googled band.[366] In November 2017, they finished the A Head Full of Dreams Tour, which is currently the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time.[367] Coldplay then headlined the Glastonbury Festival for a record-extending fifth time in 2021.[368] During the same year, "My Universe" became the first song by a British group to ever debut at number one on Billboard Hot 100.[369] In 2022, their touring gross surpassed $1 billion from 12 million tickets sold in 456 reported shows, making them the fifth band in history achieve the feat, following Bon Jovi, Eagles, the Rolling Stones and U2.[370]

The band have received numerous accolades throughout their career as well, becoming the most awarded and nominated group of all time at the Brit Awards (nine victories from 30 nominations).[371] They are the first act in history to win British Album of the Year thrice and British Group four times, scoring the most nominations for both categories.[372] Coldplay have also won seven Grammy Awards from 39 nominations, receiving Song of the Year and Record of the Year once, while being nominated for the Album of the Year category three times.[373] In January 2009, they received a NRJ Award of Honour in recognition of their career accomplishments and impact.[374] The band were then named Songwriters of the Year at the ASCAP London Music Awards in the following year,[375] having previously received the same honor from the Ivor Novello Awards in 2003.[376] Their single "Atlas", which was released as part of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) soundtrack,[377] was nominated for the 19th Critics' Choice Awards and shortlisted at the 87th Academy Awards.[378] In 2014, Coldplay were ranked as the sixth most awarded group of all time by Fuse.[379] Two years later, the band were chosen for NME Awards' Godlike Genius Award, which honours "careers of music icons who have been pioneers in the industry".[380] They have won two American Music Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, seven MTV Video Music Awards, three Juno Awards, two silver prizes at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and established 10 Guinness World Records, currently holding six of them. In May 2022, it was reported the band's estimated combined wealth (without Harvey) has surpassed £471 million.[381]

### Cultural impact

According to Steve Baltin from Forbes, Coldplay have become the standard for the current alternative music scene and "through consistent performing and adventuresome work" continue to grow "into one of the finest live bands in all of music".[383] Writing for Afisha, Sergey Stepanov affirmed they inherited U2's ability to "make alternative rock mainstream" and are "the Beatles of the 21st century" in terms of "hit-making abilities and potential heft".[384] In the Recording Academy's 20th anniversary review of Parachutes (2000), Jon O'Brien commented the album "ushered in a new wave of mild-mannered guitar bands" and "helped to open the floodgates for those who didn't subscribe to the Rock N' Roll Star way of thinking", impacting the work of groups such as the Fray, OneRepublic and Snow Patrol as well.[385] Their breakthrough single, "Yellow", is considered one of the best tracks of the 2000s decade by Pitchfork and was later included in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" exhibition for being among the most successful and important recordings in the music industry.[386] When discussing key events in the history of rock, The Guardian stated Coldplay set the genre's direction for the years to come with the song and brought a "fresh timbre of songwriting: yearning melancholy, buoyed by a sense of uplift".[387]

Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of stamps which celebrated classic British album covers from the last 40 years,[388] being also ranked as one of the best albums of all time by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[389] NME,[390] and Rolling Stone.[391] The latter magazine placed "Clocks" and "Fix You" at number 490 and 392, respectively, on their "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.[392] In 2005, Coldplay were added to the National Portrait Gallery of London, which houses a portrait collection of historically important British people.[393] Five years later, VH1 included the band in 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, a special series recognising artists based on a poll of music industry experts.[394] Their fifth album, Mylo Xyloto (2011), was part of Q's "Greatest Albums of the Last 30 Years" editorial.[395] Similarly, Rolling Stone named "Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall" one of the best tracks of the 2010s decade,[396] and "A Sky Full of Stars" was listed among the period's defining alternative rock songs by iHeartRadio.[397] The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) has credited them with boosting British music exports around the world alongside Adele and Ed Sheeran as well.[398]

Meanwhile, Firstpost's Lakshmi Govindrajan Javeri stated Coldplay have "mastered the art of reinvention" and consequently widened "the roster of artists inspired by them", which resulted in the creation of "a rich multi-genre legacy".[399] Therefore, they are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century,[400] artistically impacting numerous mainstream and indie musicians.[c] Swedish arranger Mattias Bylund explained he made "Coldplay-type rhythm chords" for Taylor Swift's "Wildest Dreams".[456] American producer Finneas O'Connell cited them as an inspiration for both his career and the production of Billie Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019).[457] South Korean music director Lee Ji-soo affirmed "Life in Technicolor II" was one of the songs that had an impact on the soundtrack for In Our Prime (2022).[458] Writing for G1, Carol Prado mentioned they helped to reshape sertanejo music in Brazil, since many prominent acts from the genre (such as Luan Santana and Victor & Leo) were influenced by the band's use of "elongated syllables" and melodies which slowly "build up to strong choruses".[459] Their music has also been sampled in various occasions,[350] including by Drake,[460] Lizzo,[461] Frank Ocean,[462] and Chance the Rapper.[463] Moreover, singers like Kelly Clarkson,[464] Kacey Musgraves,[465] Willie Nelson,[466] Robyn,[467] Rosé,[468] and Sam Smith have all covered Coldplay tracks.[469] In 2018, English actress Jodie Whittaker revealed her costume for the Thirteenth Doctor was partially inspired by the band's album covers.[470]

### Influence on live entertainment

Felipe Branco Cruz from Veja stated Coldplay "reinvented the concept of arena rock", as their live performances turned fans into the show's protagonists instead of mere spectators, consequently carrying on the legacy of spectacles "which transcend music" that was established by groups such as Pink Floyd, Queen and U2.[471] The band are widely credited with popularizing the use of interactive LED wristbands in concerts as well.[318] Acts who followed their trend include Lady Gaga,[472] OneRepublic,[318] Taylor Swift,[318] the Weeknd,[473] and Jay-Z.[318] Jason Regler, the product's creator, said his idea was conceived during a Coldplay show.[474] According to Didier Zacharie from Le Soir, the ecological plan proposed by the Music of the Spheres World Tour (2022–24) was "unprecedented" for a stadium tour,[475] leading the band to be credited with "laying down the blueprints" for environmentally friendly touring.[476] In 2022, Live Nation's Lucy August-Perna commented they helped to further build on the framework the company had been developing during the previous five years and their best practices and plans will be standardised to "provide sustainable touring options" for more artists.[477] Uproxx and Billboard recognised Coldplay's impact on Billie Eilish's Happier Than Ever, The World Tour and Shawn Mendes' Wonder: The World Tour, respectively.[478] Their work in partnership with John Wiseman (from Worldwide Sales) and Frederic Opsomer (from PRG Projects) for the stage's LED elements resulted in the creation of products "that never existed before", such as inflatable three-dimensional orbs which "dramatically" reduced the necessary space to store and transport regular models.[479] Opsomer also said the custom technology developed for the tour will become "commonplace in a few years" in the live entertainment industry, thanking the band for "having the vision and backbone" of the endeavour.[479]

## Other activities

### Philanthropy

Coldplay donates 10% from all of their profits to charity.[480] The fund is held in a bank account none of the band members can access.[481] They currently endorse more than thirty organizations,[482] including Amnesty International, Migrant Offshore Aid Station and Global Citizen Festival.[483] In 2003, an acoustic cover of the single "2000 Miles" was released to raise funds for Stop Handgun Violence and Future Forests, with all proceeds being donated to the two organizations.[484] Two years later, the group partnered with the Make Poverty History movement and were featured in one of their campaigns.[485] Coldplay have also auctioned significant memorabilia for Kids Company in 2009, including Martin's first guitar, the globe from the Parachutes (2000) album cover and costumes worn on Viva la Vida Tour (2008–10).[486] Additionally, they later became patrons for ClientEarth.[487]

The band performed a modified version of "A Message" (entitled "A Message 2010") at Hope for Haiti Now, a telethon which raised money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[488] Berryman has commented that "You can make people aware of issues. It isn't very much effort for us at all, if it can help people, then we want to do it".[489] In 2012, Album Artists staged an exhibition with artworks from Mylo Xyloto (2011) in Camden, raising £610,000 for Kids Company.[490] Martin then joined Band Aid for a second time in 2014, singing alongside British and Irish acts on a new version of "Do They Know It's Christmas?" focused on aiding the Ebola crisis in Western Africa.[491] In 2017, Coldplay made a donation of undisclosed value to University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology, the first centre dedicated to cancer immunology research in the United Kingdom, bringing "world-leading cancer scientists together under one roof".[492]

Coldplay have also contributed to the Plastic Oceans Album by Artists' Project Earth, the record was released on 20 February 2018 at the Ocean Plastics Crisis Summit in London, raising awareness and funds to counter plastic pollution.[493] Under the pseudonym Los Unidades, the band made Global Citizen – EP 1 available on the same year, with royalties being directed to the organization's efforts of education and advocacy towards the end of extreme poverty.[494] In 2020, they released a music video for "Trouble in Town", inspired by George Orwell's Animal Farm (1944), and donated all proceeds from streaming and publishing to the Innocence Project and the African Children's Feeding Scheme.[495] Coldplay declared support to the Ocean Cleanup project as well, sponsoring two watercrafts that collect plastic from polluted rivers before it reaches the sea in Malaysia.[496] As part of their efforts to make touring more sustainable, the band partnered with One Tree Planted and funded a tree for each ticket sold during Music of the Spheres World Tour (2022–24) through a global reforestation agreement.[497] According to a report published by The Times, they donated over £2.1 million to environmental causes through their J Van Mars Foundation during 2021.[381]

## Politics and activism

The band have been vocal about fair trade, supporting Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign by collecting over 70,000 signatures for their "Big Noise" petition on A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour (2002–03) and Twisted Logic Tour (2005–07).[498] Martin, who lives in the United States, spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq led by the former country along with other military forces during a Teenage Cancer Trust show at Royal Albert Hall, encouraging the crowd to "sing against war".[499] He has also backed Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama in 2004 and 2008, respectively.[500] Moreover, Coldplay are known to take part in Meat Free Mondays, a campaign launched by Paul McCartney which attempts to help slow climate change by having at least one meat free day a week.[501] In 2011, they endorsed the song "Freedom for Palestine" by posting a link to the music video on their social media and received over 12,000 comments either agreeing or disagreeing with the message.[502] Some fans threatened to boycott the band and demanded an apology to Israel.[502] The post was later deleted by Facebook after numerous people and computer generated posts reported it as "abusive".[503]

Coldplay have supported the LGBTQ community as well, sparking controversy with their Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show performance.[504] The band were accused by conservatives of promoting a "gay agenda" at the end,[504] when rainbow-coloured placards were flipped to form the phrase "Believe in Love".[505] American magazine The Advocate ranked it among the most memorable LGBTQ moments of the event.[506] In 2016, they favoured "Vote Remain" at the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.[507] Following Brexit, Martin stated the "decision does not represent us or indeed most of our generation and the generation following us".[507] A year later, the group appeared at One Love Manchester, a benefit concert organised by Ariana Grande in response to the Manchester Arena bombing which raised funds to help victims of the attack.[508] Coldplay were also special guests at Concert for Charlottesville, a show focused on aiding the victims of the Unite the Right rally.[509] In 2019, the band released Everyday Life, which saw them voicing more prominently their stance against racism, police brutality and gun violence.[279] Two years later, they were among the artists who signed a public letter endorsing the Equality Act.[510] In 2023, the Malaysian Islamic Party attempted to cancel the group's concert at Bukit Jalil National Stadium, as Martin often waves the rainbow flag while performing.[511]

## Endorsements

Despite their worldwide popularity, Coldplay have remained notoriously protective of how their material appears in media.[512] The band allow songs to be used in television shows and movies regularly, but most commercials are forbidden.[513] In 2002, NME reported they turned down over $85 million in contracts from companies including Gatorade, Diet Coke and Gap.[514] Martin stated "We would not be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that".[512] The first time one of their songs were used for advertisements was with "Viva la Vida" in 2008, the group signed a deal with Apple to promote exclusive availability of the single on iTunes Store.[515] In 2010, Martin appeared at the company's annual special event.[516] Following the death of Steve Jobs, Coldplay performed on his memorial service at Apple Campus, posthumously thanking his support.[517]

Six years later, they took part in a Target commercial which promoted the exclusive deluxe edition of Ghost Stories (2014).[518] Meanwhile, the music video for "Adventure of a Lifetime", which was directed by Mat Whitecross and recorded at The Imaginarium, had a Beats product placement.[519] The company was allowed to use some parts of the video on their commercials as a return for covering the budget. In 2018, director Jon M. Chu revealed he sent a letter directly to the band laying out all his reasons in order to get a permission for using "Yellow" on Crazy Rich Asians.[520] After it was granted, a Chinese-language cover of the track was commissioned as well.

In 2021, Coldplay announced a major partnership with German multinational BMW as part of their efforts to make touring as sustainable as possible.[521] They commented the company's technology, which includes the first recyclable car batteries in the world, is able to power live performances almost entirely from renewable energy.[522] As part of the deal, the band contributed on the marketing of two electric cars from the company and allowed "Higher Power" to be used in advertisements.[521] In 2022, DHL became Coldplay's freight partner for the Music of the Spheres World Tour (2022–24) in order to reduce the logistical impact of the shows and avoid the use of fossil fuels.[523]
